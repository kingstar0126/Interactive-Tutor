Tools, equipment and materials 
When working in the building services engineering sector of the construction industry, it is important to ensure that all tools, equipment and materials are maintained regularly and are fit for purpose.This is also be known as ‘servicing’ and can be achieved by, regular maintenance, cleaning, calibration, safe and correct storage of the tool/equipment. 


These routine maintenance principles will increase the working life of tools/equipment and ensure that their accuracy is maintained. 
Tools and equipment 
If your tools and equipment do not work as intended, you will not be able to complete the job, and you will not get paid. 
Poorly maintained tools and equipment can be dangerous and cause harm to yourself or others. Therefore, it is imperative that all the tools and equipment be correctly maintained. In addition, if tools are provided by the employer, they need to comply with the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER). 
If the tool or piece of equipment is blunt, sharpen or change it. 
If the tool or piece of equipment is dirty, clean it.
If the tool or piece of equipment needs calibration, calibrate it.
If the tool or piece of equipment needs oiling, lubricate it. 

Changing drill bits 
When using your drill, the drill bit will soon become blunt and need replacing. It is very important that this procedure is carried out safely to minimise the risks to yourself and others. 
How to change a drill bit,
1.Remove drill from the power supply/remove battery to ensure that the drill doesn’t operate when changing the bit. 

2.Ensure that the drill bit is not hot to the touch as this could cause a burn. 

3.Wearing gloves, remove the old bit and replace with the new bit, ensuring it is tightened/inserted correctly. 

4.Reinstate power/battery. 

5.Safely use the drill. 


Changing cutting blades 
Similarly, your saw/cutter blade will become blunt and need replacing. It is very important that this procedure is carried out safely to minimise the risks to yourself and others. 
How to change a cutting blade,
1.For a power tool, ensure it is electrically isolated a (always switch off for mechanical maintenance). 

2.Wearing gloves and following any manufacturer’s guidance, remove the old/damaged cutting blade. 

3.Wearing gloves and following any manufacturer’s guidance, fit the new cutting blade, ensuring that it is tightened/inserted correctly. 

4.Safely use the saw/cutter. 


Portable appliance testing (PAT) 
All electrical power tools or equipment (110V) on a building site must have a PAT test to ensure that it is safe to use. These tests must be completed every 3 months. While most electrical safety defects can be found by visual examination, some can only be detected by testing, such as, Breakdown in insulation, damage to cable sheath or badly terminated inner conductors, the plug incorrectly wired, incorrect rating of fuse. 


As laid down by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) 
Code of Practice for In-Service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment, all equipment must have its own unique serial number and all results must be recorded in an appliance register. 
Calibration 
Most electronic testing equipment requires calibration as stipulated by the manufacturer, usually every 12 months, to ensure it is still working correctly. 

Calibration is usually completed by the manufacturer of the test equipment, and a calibration certificate may be requested by the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) if there is an incident or accident. 

Examples of electronic equipment that require calibration are, electronic gas combustion analysers, electronic gas manometers, electrical test equipment, electronic measuring devices 


Cleanliness checks 
Another important maintenance requirement is to keep your tools clean. You may be working in a dirty, dusty or wet environment, and must always ensure your tools are clean. 
If a tool is dirty defects may be hidden it may be dangerous (eg blocked air-ports causing the tool to overheat) it could slip out of your hand it could clog up and bind. 


Your tools are your responsibility. 
Daily tool and equipment checks 
All tools and equipment should be visually checked for safe operation every day and before and after each use: some may have become damaged since they were last used or be too worn. 
Some engineering environments utilise a daily tool check register, whereby tools are checked or accounted for at the beginning of work, halfway through the shift and at the close of work. 

Before using a tool you should check, If the tool or piece of equipment is blunt, sharpen or change it. 
If the tool or piece of equipment is dirty, clean it. 
If the tool or piece of equipment needs calibration, calibrate it. 
If the tool or piece of equipment needs oiling, lubricate it.

Step – Inspect the hacksaw. Step – Remove debris, dirt and corrosion. Step – Remove old cutting blade. Step – Replace any worn parts. Step – Replace with new blade. Step – Lubricate any bolts. 

Maintenance of tools 
How to maintain a combustion analyser 
Step 1 – Inspect the combustion analyser. Step 2 – Return to service centre annually. Step 3 – Use as per manufacturer’s guidelines. 

Safe storage of tools 
You should strive to store your tools safely and carefully so that they will last a long time and be ready for use when required. 
If a tool has a storage box/container, use it if possible to provide protection. If not, store the tool where it will not get damaged. 
Replacing good quality tools can be expensive: always take good care of them. 
Condition reports 
A condition report is completed as part of the planned preventative maintenance schedule for a tool or piece of equipment and details the condition of the tool or piece of equipment and whether any remedial maintenance is required. The focus is commonly on areas such as: 
damage to the outside of the tool or piece of equipment; 
whether any parts need replacing
whether any fluid levels need topping up 
whether the tool or piece of equipment is within its calibration period. 


These areas are assessed, and the report is provided to the client to carry out any remedial work required. 
Asset registers 
An asset register is a resource that details all the different assets owned or managed by a company. For example: 
tools
equipment
materials 
vehicles 
offices. 


An asset register is an important document for evaluating how much a company is worth. 

Materials 
When carrying out work in the BSE sector of the construction industry, it is important to remember that your role is to provide the services into the property – plumbing, gas, electricity, drainage, communications, etc. As you are responsible for installations it is important that all materials used: 
• 
are fit for purpose – eg whether they comply with CE (European standards), BS (kite mark for British standards) and/or BASEC (British Approvals Service for Cables) 

• 
are safe: they do not present any hazards to the installation 

• 
are sized and ordered correctly, eg, pipe and cable sizes 

• 
allow for any special requirements, ie any possible future extensions to the installation, such as more radiators or additional bathrooms. 


Materials 
When taking delivery of any materials, it is important to check their condition and that the delivery note matches the requisition order. This is because any defects identified on delivery can be discussed immediately. Do not sign for an order until you are satisfied that it is complete and of the correct standard. 
Always survey the job and order the correct amount of materials to keep costs down and minimise wastage, promoting sustainability. 
If there are any unused materials, ensure they are stored correctly and carefully, as they could be used for a different job, saving money and reducing wastage. 
Remember: ‘measure twice and cut once’. 
Tools that fail safety checks 
Any tool that fails a safety check should either be repaired or replaced. This is important as the continued use of that tool will constitute a danger to you and possibly someone else. 
• 
Tools such as chisels, which are liable to impact damage, need to be checked to ensure their head is not split or mushroomed. 

• 
If a drill bit is broken, it can either be resharpened or replaced. 

• 
If a cutting blade is blunt, it can either be sharpened (chisel, etc) or replaced (hacksaw, etc). This can create waste if copper pipe or electrical cable is cut incorrectly. 

• 
If an electrical power tool is damaged it can either be repaired or replaced. 


Any such failure must be actioned immediately. 
Tools that fail safety checks 
If a tool fails a safety check, take the following steps. 
1. 
Remove from service. 


2. 
Label as being inoperative. 

3. 
Lock away. 

4. 
Arrange repair. 




Electrical supply 
There are three types of electrical supply for power tools and equipment on site: 
• 230V ac • 110V ac 
• 4.5V to 54V dc (using a rechargable battery). 
All of these can be dangerous, to different extents. 


230V supply 
Electrical tools that are powered by 230V ac supplies are the most likely to deliver a fatal electric shock if damaged or used incorrectly. 
All 230V electrical power tools utilise a 3-pin plug, designed to be plugged into the electrical sockets of a domestic property. 
However, in accordance with the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989, 230V power tools are not allowed to be used on construction sites. 
110V supply 
Electrical tools powered by 110V ac are safer to use than 230V because the voltage is lower. However, they can also be very dangerous if damaged or used incorrectly. 
All 110V electrical power tools utilise a yellow industrial socket (‘commando socket’), which is very robust and especially appropriate for hazardous environments. Such sockets must comply with IEC 60309. 

Battery power 
Batteries for electrical tools can vary in power from 4.5V to 54V dc. This type of power supply is the safest way of powering tools due to the low voltage and use of direct current. However, it is important to note that these tools can be dangerous if damaged or used incorrectly. 
All battery powered electrical power tool cells are charged using a battery charger, which can be powered by 230V or 110V. 








Chapter 1 Health and safety in construction 





1.1 The role of legislation and regulations in the construction industry 
Working in the construction industry can be extremely hazardous. In 1974, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HASAWA) was introduced. It replaced many older laws and enabled new regulations to be passed in Parliament to protect workers and the general public from work activities. 
The main objectives of HASAWA are to: 
• 
secure the health, safety and welfare of people at work 

• 
protect people other than those at work (for example the general public or visitors) from risks to health or safety arising out of or in connection with work activities 

• 
control the possession and use of highly flammable, explosive and dangerous substances. 


Everyone has a moral responsibility to protect the health and safety of themselves and others at work. However, under HASAWA some parties – known as duty holders – have legal responsibilities. Employers, employees, the self-employed, manufacturers and people in control of premises are all duty holders. 

Shortly after HASAWA was introduced, the UK government established the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE is an independent regulator that aims to prevent workplace ill health, injury and death by targeting industries with the greatest risks and worst risk-management records, which include construction and manufacturing. 
The HSE provides advice and guidance to employers so that they can identify hazards and manage risks correctly. Its emphasis is on the prevention of accidents and ill health by raising awareness in workplaces, so that workers and other people can stay safe and well. 

The HSE has legal powers to hold people or companies to account when risks are not managed and legislation is breached. We will look at how the HSE enforces HASAWA later in this chapter. 
Legislation made under HASAWA is divided into a number of different regulations. Table 1.1 outlines the main regulations that control health, safety and welfare in the construction industry. 
. Table 1.1 Main regulations that control health, safety and welfare in the construction industry 
Regulation  Overview  
Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and  These regulations place legal duties on employers, the self-employed  
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations  and people in control of premises to report to the HSE serious accidents,  
(RIDDOR) 2013  dangerous occurrences and occupational diseases resulting from workplace activities.  
Control of Substances Hazardous to  These regulations state that employers must control substances hazardous to  
Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002  health by preventing or reducing workers’ exposure. This can be achieved by: • finding out what the health hazards are • deciding how to prevent harm to health by assessing the risks (risk assessment) • providing control measures, such as secure storage for chemicals • making sure that control measures are followed • maintaining control measures • providing training, information and instruction for employees and others • monitoring and providing health surveillance when necessary • planning for emergencies. Note: asbestos is not covered by COSHH Regulations.  
Regulation  Overview  
Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012  There are several different types of asbestos that have been used in the construction industry, some of which are more hazardous than others. In most cases, asbestos can only be removed by a licensed contractor. However, small quantities of lower-risk asbestos can be removed by non-licensed contractors, providing they are competent and have effective controls in place. The law states that before doing any building work or maintenance on premises or on plant and equipment that contain asbestos, a risk assessment has to be carried out to manage and control the risks. It is mandatory for anyone who is likely to be exposed to asbestos fibres at work to receive training.  
Provision and Use of Work Equipment  These regulations place duties on people and organisations that operate or  
Regulations (PUWER) 1998  have control over work equipment. They state that: • equipment must be suitable for its intended use • equipment must be safe, maintained and regularly inspected • people who use the equipment must have received training, information and instruction • equipment must be used accompanied by suitable health and safety measures, for example guarding or emergency stop devices.  
Manual Handling Operations Regulations (MHOR) 1992  These regulations define manual handling as ‘any transporting or supporting of a load ... by hand or bodily force’. They set out a hierarchy of control measures for dealing with the risks posed by manual handling: 1 Avoid hazardous manual handling operations so far as is reasonably practicable. 2 Assess any hazardous manual handling operations that cannot be avoided. 3 Reduce the risk of injury so far as is reasonably practicable.  
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at Work Regulations 1992 (Note: the current legislation which refers to the supply of PPE is the Personal Protective Equipment Regulations 2016/425, which is enforced by the Personal Protective Equipment (Enforcement) Regulations 2018)  These regulations relate to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Employers have a responsibility to provide PPE free of charge to employees to control the hazards identified in risk assessments. They should also provide information, instruction and training on how to use it and take care of it.  
Work at Height Regulations 2005  Under these regulations, people who are in control of others working at height have a duty to make sure work is properly planned, supervised and carried out by competent people. All work at height must be risk assessed.  
Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005  Exposure to high levels of noise can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. Employers have a duty to reduce the risk by: • assessing the risks • eliminating or controlling the noise • providing hearing protection • providing hearing checks for those at risk • providing employees with information and training • maintaining any noise-control equipment and ensuring it is being used.  
Control of Vibration at Work Regulations 2005  These regulations place a duty on employers to reduce the risk to employees’ health from exposure to vibration caused by work equipment, machinery and tools, for example when using a core drill. Employers must calculate the amount of vibration that employees may be exposed to at work. At a specific level (referred to as the ‘exposure action value’), employers must introduce technical and organisational measures to reduce the risk of personal injury to an acceptable level. The law also prevents workers from being exposed to a higher exposure limit value of 5.0 m/s² A(8).  

. Table 1.1 Main regulations that control health, safety and welfare in the construction industry 
Regulation  Overview  
Confined Spaces Regulations 1997  The aim of these regulations is to prevent people working in confined spaces whenever possible, because of the serious risk to health and safety from collapse, drowning, low oxygen levels and exposure to natural gases. If the activity is unavoidable, a safe system of work must be followed to control the risk.  
Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999  These regulations apply to every work activity. They explain what employers need to do to manage health and safety at their place of work under HASAWA. The main requirement is for employers to complete a risk assessment and record significant findings when they have five or more employees.  
Electricity at Work Regulations 1989  These regulations outline the responsibilities of those involved in the design, operation, construction and maintenance of electrical equipment and systems. They are relevant to most work activities and premises, except certain offshore installations and particular ships.  
Environmental legislation  There are numerous environmental laws in the UK that protect wildlife, the countryside, listed buildings, national parks and monuments, for example the Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The environment is protected further by the Planning and Energy Act 2008, Energy Act 2020 and Climate Change Act 2008. The Climate Change Act 2008 is an environmental law designed to meet the UK government’s target to reduce carbon emissions recorded in 1990 by at least 80 per cent by 2050.  
Waste management legislation  There are several requirements for handling waste, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2013, as well as regulations on waste carriers. For more information, see Chapter 5, section 7.  



and BSE industries. These changes are often made with guidance and support from the following bodies: 

employers 
unions 
trade associations 
professional bodies 
academics. 




1.2 Regulations relating to the provision of welfare facilities during construction work 
Under HASAWA, employers have a duty to provide basic welfare facilities for their employees at their place of work. The Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) Regulations 2015 outline the minimum facilities that should be provided on construction sites: 
• Drinking water: 
– 
An adequate supply of fresh drinking water should be appropriately labelled and accessible in suitable places. 

– 
An adequate supply of cups or other drinking vessels must be provided, unless the water is supplied from a fountain for workers to drink easily. 


• Toilets: 
– 
These should be separate for men and women, with doors that are lockable from the inside. 

– 
They should be clean and maintained with adequate ventilation and lighting. 


• Washing facilities: 
– 
These should be located in the vicinity of the toilets and changing rooms, with clean cold and hot or warm running water if possible. 

– 
Soap or another means of cleaning must be provided, along with towels or another suitable method of drying. 

– 
Showers may also need to be provided if the nature of the work requires it. 


• Rest facilities: 
– 
These should be equipped with tables and seating with backs for the number of people expected to use them. 

– 
The rest area must be able to maintain an appropriate temperature and have facilities to prepare and eat meals and boil water. 


• Changing rooms with lockers: 
– 
These must be provided if workers have to wear special clothing for their job, unless they can be reasonably expected to change elsewhere. 

– 
Changing rooms should be provided with seating and facilities to dry and store clothing. 

– 
Separate rooms must be provided for men and women. 




. Figure 1.1 Welfare facilities on a construction site 
1.3 Implications of not adhering to legislation 
Health and safety law is made up of Acts of Parliament and statutory regulations. Failure to comply with them is a criminal offence. HSE inspectors have a number of powers to enforce the law, including carrying out inspections, issuing simple cautions and notices to duty holders, and sometimes initiating prosecutions. 
The law states that HSE inspectors can enter a workplace without notice at any reasonable time to conduct an inspection or investigation. During a visit, they may want to speak to workers, look at possible health risks, and inspect equipment and machinery. They can also take samples, such as sound and dust levels, photographs and measurements, and make copies of records or other documentation needed as part of their investigation. 
If the inspector thinks that the employer has broken the law, they will issue a ‘notification of contravention’. This document outlines what laws have been broken and how, and what needs to be done to put things right. 
An HSE inspector may issue an improvement notice when one or more laws have been breached; this means that faults have to be remedied within a specific period of time, which should be no less than 21 days. 
If there has been a serious breach of the law and people are at risk of immediate harm, the HSE will issue a prohibition notice, preventing work from continuing. 
Failure to comply with improvement or prohibition notices can result in prosecution, fines and imprisonment. 

When people suffer loss or injury as a result of an accident at work, they may seek compensation. If health and safety legislation has been breached, the duty holder is usually fined because they have broken criminal law. Magistrates and the Crown Court have a discretionary power to award compensation to an injured person. However, claims are usually pursued by the injured person because of a breach of common law. 
Employers should have liability insurance to cover any claims against them for a breach of common law; however they cannot insure against fines when they 


1.4 Statutory and non-statutory documents in construction 
The UK construction industry is subject to a number of laws which cover many different areas, including health, safety and welfare. Legislation comprises Acts of Parliament and regulations (statutory legislation) which have legal status and must be complied with. However, there are also many non-statutory guidance documents, which are not compulsory but offer advice on good practice and compliance with the law, for example the Approved Codes of Practice (ACOPs) produced by the HSE which describe preferred methods and standards. Unless stated, you do not need to follow the ACOP guidance, but in doing so you will meet the requirements of HASAWA. The HSE states that other practical methods can be used, but they must meet or exceed the standards in the ACOP.

. Figure 1.2 An Approved Code of Practice 


2.1Current requirements 
We have already seen that the HSE has the power to issue fines to employers and other duty holders if they neglect the law. The fines issued by the HSE are intended to punish employers financially; therefore they cannot insure against them. 
However, employers can protect themselves with insurance against claims made by employees through the common-law courts in the pursuit of compensation. In this section, we will look at the different types of insurance that employers may have. 
Public liability insurance 
Public liability insurance protects a business against claims for compensation for any loss or injury to members of the public, customers or employees in connection with work activities. 
There is no legal requirement for employers to have public liability insurance. However, if they engage with the public, or the public and their property are likely to be affected by the employer’s work activities, then they should have this insurance to protect themselves from any potential claims made against them. 
The level of insurance protection is determined by the nature and scale of the work undertaken. Some clients will stipulate the minimum level of insurance cover needed by a contractor, and have it agreed in writing before awarding any contracts or allowing construction work to start. 
Employers’ liability insurance 
Common law is legislation that places a duty of care on employers to protect their employees from any unnecessary risks, and to ensure a safe system of work. If a person is injured or suffers a loss in the workplace, they may seek financial compensation from the employer if they are liable. 

Under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, all employers are required by law to insure against liability for injury or disease to their employees arising out of their employment and any financial claims made against them. 

The amount of liability insurance an employer needs is usually determined by the number of employees and level of risk involved with their business. However, the minimum amount of cover for most insurance policies starts between 5 and 10 million pounds. If the injured person was successful with their claim against the employer, the compensation would go towards the recovery of their lost earnings, medical treatment, ongoing care and any legal fees. 


3.1 The HSE Legal (L) Series 
In 2015, the Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) Regulations came into force. Their aim was to manage health, safety and welfare on all construction projects by defining roles for duty holders. People with responsibilities under the regulations include clients, designers and contractors. If there is more than one designer or contractor working on the same construction project, a principal designer or principal contractor must be appointed (named). Any other designers or contractors must work under the control of the principal designer or contractor. 
The CDM Regulations state that where possible the designer (or principal designer) should plan for health and safety by identifying then eliminating or minimising all foreseeable risks at the planning stage of a project. They also state that all construction work, regardless of size, should have a ‘construction phase plan’. This is a key document that identifies all the potential hazards for a project and the measures that will be used to remove or mitigate them. 
Contractors and principal contractors have a duty under the CDM Regulations to: 
• 
provide site inductions for all workers and visitors to the site 

• 
provide suitable welfare facilities 

• 
secure the site to prevent unauthorised access and protect non-workers (for example members of the public). 


The HSE has published a range of documents known as the HSE Legal (L) Series (also referred to as the CDM Series). Their primary purpose is to support duty holders in meeting their obligations under the CDM Regulations. They are available online to download for free, or a hard copy can be purchased through the HSE’s website. The L Series contains both Approved Codes of Practice (ACOPs) and guidance on various health, safety and welfare regulations. 

3.2Legionnaires’ disease: the control of Legionella bacteria in water systems (L8) 
Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria that naturally occur in fresh­water environments such as streams and lakes. It can be contracted by inhaling infected airborne water droplets and can be fatal. 

‘Legionnaires’ disease: The control of Legionella bacteria in water systems (L8)’ is an example of an ACOP and part of the HSE’s L Series. It outlines the responsibilities that employers and further duty holders have towards others in relation to Legionella. The latest (fourth) edition of the document provides revisions to simplify some of the text contained in the regulations (for example COSHH). 
The ACOP provides practical advice to prevent the growth and spread of Legionella bacteria in manmade water systems. The first step in managing the risk is to complete a suitable and sufficient Legionella risk assessment (LRA), to identify the source of any risk. The ACOP recognises the importance of the LRA and states that it must be completed by a trained and competent person who fully understands the water systems being evaluated. Risk assessments must be regularly reviewed and updated when changes are necessary as a result of a review, to keep records up to date and current. 
The ACOP states that duty holders must appoint a competent person (known as a responsible person) with suitable authority to manage the day-to-day operational procedures, to make sure ‘effective and timely’ actions are taken to manage the hazards identified in the risk assessment. 
In addition to risk assessments, the L8 ACOP describes other methods of implementing control schemes and measures, including managing, monitoring precautions and inspection. 

. Figure 1.3 A plumber installing a water system 


4.1 Development and use of safe systems of work in construction projects 
There are different types of management system that can be used to create safe systems of work. However, the HSE favours the following approach, which can be applied to most construction businesses: 
• 
Plan – for specific health and safety objectives 

• 
Do – implement the plan 

• 
Check – that the plan is working and measure performance, for example the number of accidents and near misses 

• 
Act – learn from any mistakes and put them right. 



The law states that every employer must have a policy for managing health and safety, and that it must be in written form if they have five or more employees. A health and safety policy sets out the general approach an employer has towards managing health and safety in their business and is divided into three sections: 
• 
general statement of intent (the employer’s commitment) 

• 
arrangements (what the employer intends to do and how) 

• 
responsibilities (areas of responsibility within their business and defining roles). 


The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 contain a schedule known as the ‘General principles of prevention’. This provides a hierarchy of control measures for employers to manage risks to health and safety in the workplace (see Figure 1.4). 
Develop an overall prevention policy covering technology, organisation of work and working conditions 
Prioritise collective protective measures over individual measures 
Give appropriate instruction to employees 

. Figure 1.4 Hierarchy of control measures for managing health and safety risks (source: www.legislation.gov.uk) 

4.2 How to complete risk assessments 
The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 place a legal duty on employers to manage the risk of potential harm to people from work activities. A risk assessment that identifies hazards and determines measures to eliminate or control them is fundamental to reducing work-related accidents and ill health. 
Risk assessments should not be designed to produce lots of paperwork, neither do they need to be complicated or difficult to understand. A risk assessment should be a structured examination of workplace activities, appropriate and proportional to the level of risk and the nature of the hazards. It should be site and task specific; therefore generic risk assessments would not be considered suitable or sufficient. 
Completing a risk assessment is a five-step process: 1 Identify hazards and potential hazards (what could 
cause injury or illness). 2 Decide who might be harmed and how. 3 Assess the risks by looking at the likelihood of 
the hazard causing harm and the severity of that harm. 

4 Establish control measures to remove or reduce the risk of harm. (Look at what you are already doing to protect people, what future actions need to be taken and who needs to take those actions). 
5 Record any significant hazards found (when there are five or more employees) and review the assessment after the control measures have been put in place to see if they are working, or if anything further could be done. 

. Figure 1.5 A hazard on a building site 
As part of a good management system, employers should prioritise the highest-level risks before assessing medium-level risks. Once all of these hazards have been identified and eliminated or controlled in some way to a satisfactory level, lower­risk activities should be risk assessed. 
Risk assessments should be completed by a competent person with a satisfactory level of knowledge and experience. For more complex activities, the person completing them may seek advice from other sources, such as the HSE or trade organisations. Employers with five or more employees are required by law to record significant findings from their risk assessments.

3 Major injury/extensive damage  3  6  9  

1 – Low risk: action should be taken to reduce the risk if reasonably practicable. 
2, 3, 4 – Medium risk: is a significant risk and would require an appropriate level of resource. 
6 & 9 – High risk: may require considerable resourced to mitigate. Control should focus on elimination of risk, if not possible control should be obtained by following the hierarchy of control. 
. Figure 1.6 A risk assessment 


4.3 How to write method statements 
Method statements are documents prepared by employers that describe a logical sequence of steps to complete a work activity in a safe manner. They reflect the hazards identified in risk assessments and describe the way in which the job should be undertaken. 

These documents are used as part of a safe system of work to communicate vital health and safety information and guidance to people completing the activity; together with risk assessments they are referred to as RAMS (risk assessments and method statements). 
A typical method statement describes: 
• 
hazards identified 

• 
safe access and egress 

• 
supervision needed 

• 
hazardous substances and how to control them 

• 
permit-to-work systems (if applicable) 

• 
personal protective equipment 

• 
emergency procedures 

• 
environmental controls 

• 
health and safety monitoring 

• 
workforce details. 


Although method statements are an effective way of keeping people safe at work, there is no legal requirement for employers to produce them. However, they are often requested by principal contractors. 


4.4 How to complete a COSHH assessment 
Hazardous substances can take many forms, including chemicals, dust and biological agents, and are not just products labelled as hazardous. 
People at work are often exposed to hazardous substances and may be at risk of long-term (chronic) health problems such as asthma, cancer and skin disease. 
Employers and the self-employed have a legal duty under the COSHH Regulations to assess the risk to their employees and others from exposure to 
Most effective method 
Elimination: 

Least effective method 
Substitution: 

products and processes that may contain or create substances harmful to health. If they have five or more employees, these assessments must be written down. 
The main legal requirement is to use appropriate control measures to prevent harm from exposure, and this can be achieved by applying the hierarchy of control measures outlined in Figure 1.8. 

   Administrative controls:
   provide information, training and instructions to change the way people think and work, e.g. safety signs, site inductions and toolbox talks 
PPE: as a last resort, protect individuals with personal protective equipment 

. Figure 1.8 Hierarchy of control measures to prevent exposure 
By law, suppliers must provide up-to-date safety data sheets for any hazardous substances. These contain the supplier’s information about a product and should not be confused with COSHH assessments. 


Steps to follow to complete a COSHH assessment: 
1 Identify the hazardous substance, who is likely to be harmed and how. 
2 Evaluate the risk of the hazard causing harm by considering frequency of exposure to the substance and what effects it could have. 
3 Decide what reasonably practicable measures are necessary to prevent or control any exposure to the hazard and how these will be maintained; make a plan for emergencies. 
4 Record the assessment. 
5 Decide if and when the assessment needs to be reviewed, and by whom. 
Company name: Patio path and paving Department:  Date assessment made: Date discussed with employees:  
Step 1 Substance  Step 2  Step 3  Step 4 Action  
What is the hazard?  What harm, and who?  What are you doing already?   What improvements do you need?   Who  When  Check  
Breathing in dust from cutting paving   Long-term lung damage, e.g. bronchitis and silicosis. Everyone involved in cutting and anyone working nearby     Water to suppress dust. Protective goggles     Get enough water. Those involved should wear P3 respirators, ear plugs     
Breathing in exhaust fumes from cutter   Carbon monoxide poisoning. Everyone nearby    Always use cutter outdoors   Make sure area is not enclosed and fumes can disperse

. Figure 1.9 A COSHH assessment 


4.5 Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) 
The Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) is one of many industry-recognised card schemes accredited by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB). CSCS cards prove that the card holder has a satisfactory level of health and safety awareness; they also show relevant qualifications the holder has achieved to confirm they are working in the correct job role on site. 
There are various types of CSCS card, designed to suit people working at different levels in the construction industry, from labourers to academically and professionally qualified managers. CSCS cards last a maximum of five years before the holders have to reapply, however once an apprentice or trainee card has expired it cannot be renewed. There is no legal requirement for workers to hold a CSCS card, although most principal contractors and clients require people to have them as a way of managing health and safety on sites under their control. 

. Figure 1.10 CSCS cards 
To qualify for a basic CSCS card, a candidate must first successfully complete the CITB (Site Safety Plus) Health and Safety Awareness course and test. They must then pass the online CITB Health, Safety and Environment test before they are allowed to apply for an appropriate CSCS card. 

4.6Site Management Safety Training Scheme (SMSTS) 
Principal contractors and clients usually require people with planning, organising, controlling and monitoring responsibilities (for example site managers) to hold the Site Management Safety Training Scheme (SMSTS) qualification. This qualification ensures that the holder is up to date with health, safety, welfare and environmental legislation, so that they can fulfil their legal responsibilities. Every five years, the holder has to complete the Site Management Safety Training Scheme Refresher (SMSTS-R) to retain the qualification and to make sure they are aware of any changes in legislation, new guidance and industry best practice. 
4.7 Site Supervision Safety Training Scheme (SSSTS) 
The Site Supervision Safety Training Scheme (SSSTS) is a similar qualification to the SMSTS. It is designed for people with supervisory responsibilities or those preparing to start in this role and provides an understanding of topics such as site inductions, risk assessments and method statements. Every five years, the Site Supervision Safety Training Scheme Refresher (SSSTS-R) course has to be completed, to keep up to date with any changes that affect the supervisory role and to retain the qualification status. 

5.1 Procedures that promote and support safety consciousness 
HASAWA states that employers have a duty to provide information, instruction and training to their employees, so that they know how to work safely without risks to health. Employees and the self­employed should be made aware of: 
• 
the hazards and risks they may face 

• 
control measures that are in place to deal with hazards 

• 
what to do in the event of an emergency, for example assemble at the designated muster point (assembly point). 


Employers must pay particular attention to certain groups, such as young people, new recruits and people changing roles, because they are less likely to be aware of potential risks and therefore require additional training and support. 
Under the Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) Regulations 2015, principal contractors must engage with workers about their health, safety and welfare, and provide a site-specific induction and any other information and training that they need. Before entering a workplace, people should be made aware of potential hazards and the measures they need to take to protect themselves and others. On construction sites, this is usually achieved by following the site rules displayed on notice boards and safety signs. All workers and visitors to site have to sign in, so that the site manager is aware of who is on site at all times, especially in the event of an emergency. Visitors and new workers will have to attend a site induction, where they will be informed about: 
• 
hazards 

• 
site rules 

• 
personal protective equipment (PPE) 

• 
welfare facilities 

• 
first aid 

• 
fire extinguishers 

• 
emergency procedures 

• 
key personnel (for example site manager, assistant manager, supervisors, first aider) 

• 
pedestrian routes 

• 
parking 

• 
working hours 

• 
waste and the environment 

• 
boundaries 

• 
working at height 

• 
traffic-management plans 

• 
permits to work 

• 
security 

• 
risk assessments and method statements (RAMS). 




The duration of a site induction will depend on the size and nature of the work and the personnel undertaking the training. Experienced workers or designers (architects and engineers) may only need to attend a brief site induction, whereas someone that is newly qualified will need to attend a full induction. Inductions must be completed for every new site that is visited, regardless of whether the person is working for the same employer or principal contractor. 
It is likely that the conditions and hazards on a site will evolve as work progresses, after people have attended a site induction. Workers will need to be updated on any matters of health and safety when necessary. Short presentations known as toolbox talks are often used to provide this information to workers. These are usually delivered to small groups of workers, in an area of the workplace where they should not be disturbed. These talks usually cover a single aspect of health and safety, such as good housekeeping (keeping areas clean and clear). 

5.2 Benefits of procedures that promote and support safety consciousness 
It is important to remember that employees have duties under HASAWA, as well as employers, and that every effort must be made to comply with the law. 
The law states that employees must: 
• 
take care of their own health and safety and that of others 

• 
report any work situations that present a serious and imminent risk 

• 
co-operate with their employer to help them comply with health and safety legislation 

• 
follow any instructions or health and safety training provided by their employer 

• 
inform their employer of any shortcomings they identify in their health and safety arrangements. 


When an employee fails in these responsibilities or does not follow their employer’s health and safety procedures, they are essentially breaking the law and could be putting themselves and others at risk of injury, illness or death. 
Accidents and near misses in the workplace often cost the employer in terms of time, effort and money. There may also be penalties imposed on them by the HSE and civil claims made against them. 
A workplace accident could also result in indirect costs for the employer, such as: 
• 
project timescales slipping and missed deadlines 

• 
time spent training new staff 

• 
increased insurance premiums. 


Employers with a poor health and safety record usually have difficulty retaining staff, because they do not feel safe in their place of work. It also leads to low morale and a negative health and safety culture, which in turn makes it challenging to recruit new employees. 
Poor standards of health and safety can also have a detrimental effect on future contracts and potentially result in losing business. 



6.1 Methods used to inspect a workplace to ensure it is safe 
Employers have a responsibility to monitor health and safety arrangements in the workplace, to ensure they are effectively controlling risks. 
There are two types of monitoring system that are typically used in the construction industry: 
• 
Active monitoring is the monitoring of people, procedures, premises and plant in the workplace in order to identify potential hazards before an accident or incident occurs, so that control measures can be taken to prevent harm. 

• 
Reactive monitoring is an inspection completed after an incident has taken place, for example a review of accident forms or statistics which might identify an area of concern, such as skin burns from welding equipment or falls from height. 


Although reactive monitoring is a review of performance standards, it is a useful method of identifying problems to prevent further accidents and incidents occurring and should be used alongside active monitoring. 




6.2 Monitoring health and safety in the workplace 
As part of a good health and safety management system, employers should plan a programme of statutory, routine, periodic and pre-use inspections of equipment and their workplace. The frequency of the inspections will be determined by a number of factors, for example pre-use inspections of safety equipment may be completed daily by employees, whereas a periodic inspection of lifting equipment could be every six months, as determined by the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations (LOLER) 1998. 

. Figure 1.13 A construction crane covered by LOLER 
Active monitoring should involve structured, well­planned and organised examinations carried out by competent, experienced inspectors. Employers must decide: 
• 
what type of inspections need to be completed 

• 
who needs to be involved 

• 
what analytical equipment may be needed, even if this means consulting specialists. 



There are various types of health and safety inspection that can be implemented in the workplace: 
• 
Health and safety audits (also known as desktop audits) are used to inspect health and safety documentation used in the workplace. 

• 
Safety sampling is used to focus an investigation on a representative sample of a workplace standard, for example a random selection of portable electrical equipment could be selected to check if portable appliance testing (PAT) is up to date. If a big enough sample is selected, then it is likely to reflect any issues that may be identified on a wider scale within the company. 

• 
Safety surveys are often used to focus a detailed health and safety investigation on a particular topic or issue, rather than the workplace as a whole. 

• 
Safety tours are full inspections of entire workplaces to identify any hazards or shortcomings in employers’ or employees’ health and safety responsibilities. 

• 
Incident inspections are carried out after an accident, a near miss or a case of reported ill health to the HSE. 


Routine health and safety inspections are often guided by checklists and templates of set items that must be covered. These provide excellent prompts and are easy to complete with little training. They are also cheap, easy to reproduce and provide a consistent approach for every inspection, regardless of who completes it. The disadvantage is that hazards can often be overlooked if they are not listed, and therefore this form of inspection is not always preferred. 
A random visual or sensory inspection of a work area by a team of representatives is sometimes a better way of identifying all potential hazards, because inspectors are not restricted by a checklist or template. 
6.3 Types and use of recording documentation 
Employers and their safety representatives are responsible for recording all inspections in a clear written report, as soon as possible after they have taken place. In some cases, this is a legal duty. 
The report should contain: 
• 
the date the inspection took place 

• 
any potential hazards or defects found 

• 
when the next inspection is due. 


Inspection reports are then used to inform an action plan to put right any problems identified. An action plan should detail: 
• 
any corrective actions needed 

• 
people with responsibilities for carrying out the corrective actions 

• 
the timescale in which the corrective actions must be completed. 



Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (PUWER) 1998, employers have specific duties to ensure that equipment provided for use at work is: 
‘… maintained in a safe condition and inspected 
to ensure it is correctly installed and does not 
subsequently deteriorate.’ 
Other legislation, such as the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations (LOLER) 1998, the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations (PSSR) 2000, the Work at Height Regulations 2005 and the Personal Protective Equipment Regulations 2002, also give specific duties to employers to examine work equipment and keep an up-to-date register of all inspections. 
It is important that employers maintain these inspection records because they may be referred to in the event of an investigation into an accident or near miss in the workplace. Inspection records, maintenance schedules and service plans could also be requested by HSE inspectors or required by an employer’s insurance company. 

7.1Roles and responsibilities of those working in the BSE industry 
The main roles and responsibilities of people working in the building services engineering industry are no different from those of people working in the construction industry. Building services engineering and construction are considered high-risk industries; therefore the HSE is the authority responsible for enforcing the relevant legislation. 

The following people have general duties under health and safety law: 
• 
employers 

• 
employees 

• 
people in control of premises 

• 
manufacturers of products, goods or materials used in the construction industry. 

The general duties of employers towards their employees are to: 

• 
protect the health, safety and welfare of their employees so far as is reasonably practicable 

• 
ensure plant and systems of work are maintained and safe 

• 
ensure the safe use, handling, storage and transport of articles and substances 

• 
provide information, instruction, training and supervision to their employees 

• 
ensure any place of work under their control is safe and without risks to health, including access and egress 

• 
ensure the provision and maintenance of adequate welfare facilities. 



The implications of not following health and safety legislation were made clear in section 1.3 of this chapter: improvement notices, prohibition notices and prosecution. 

During the installation and maintenance of Building Services Engineering systems, engineers are required to isolate a range of supplies: 
• 
water supplies (hot and cold) 

• 
gas supplies 

• 
electrical supplies. 


It is important that isolation is carried out safely and in accordance with relevant guidance documents and set procedures. 
Prior to isolating any building services system, the responsible person should be informed and should also be advised as to how long the system will be out of action (decommissioned). Where applicable you should 


always arrange for alternative services to be provided. 



8.1 Water supplies (hot and cold) 
When working on both cold and hot water supplies, it is important to know where to safely isolate the system. Isolation valves turn off (isolate) either complete systems, parts of systems or individual appliances. They can be divided into the following types: 
• 
those that isolate high-pressure systems, such as stop valves 

• 
those that isolate low-pressure systems, such as full-way gate valves 

• 
those that isolate appliances and terminal fittings on either high- or low-pressure systems. 


Where isolation valves are not in place, a pipe freezing kit can be used to isolate the system. 
Direct cold water systems can be completely isolated at the main stop valve where the supply enters the building. If this is used to isolate the water supply, both the hot and cold water will be isolated. 
Indirect cold water systems can be isolated at the gate valve located on the distribution pipe connected to the cold water storage cistern. If the cold water storage cistern requires replacement, it will need to be isolated at the service valve supplying it. 


Unvented hot water systems can be isolated at the service valve on the cold water supply to the cylinder. 

Isolation valve 

. Figure 1.16 Isolating an unvented hot water system 
Where hot water in a property is supplied from a combination boiler or water heater, this should be isolated at the service valve located under the boiler. (Remember to isolate the electrical supply.) 

. Figure 1.17 Isolating a combination boiler or water heater 
Vented hot water systems are isolated at the gate valve supplying the hot water cylinder. 


At the point of isolation, a warning notice should be displayed informing people that the system is out of order and not to use it. This will prevent the system being turned on while it is being worked on. 

Where there are open ends on hot and cold water supply pipework, these should be capped off using a suitable fitting. 




Gas supplies 
It is not permitted to isolate a gas supply in the event of an emergency, unless you are a gas safe registered engineer. 
Located at the inlet of the gas meter is an emergency control valve (ECV) which is used to isolate the gas supply to a property. The ECV should: 
• 
fall to the ‘off’ position 

• 
have on/off tape indicating the direction to close the valve 

• 
move freely. 



. Figure 1.20 Gas meter showing the position of the ECV 
In the event of an emergency gas situation, the following procedure should be followed: 
• 
Turn off the ECV 

• 
Open doors and windows to ventilate the property 

• 
Call the National Gas Emergency Service number 

• 
DON’T turn any power or light switches on or off 

• 
DON’T light any sort of flame within the property 

• 
DON’T use any appliances that could cause a spark. 


As stated in the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, there should be an isolation valve at the inlet of all gas appliances to aid localised isolation of the supply. 

. Figure 1.21 Appliance gas isolation valve 


8.3Electrical supplies 
Before any work is carried out on electrical systems, the isolation procedure should be carried out to ensure the installation is safe to be worked on. 
When you isolate an electricity supply, there will be disruption. Careful planning should precede isolation of circuits. For example, when isolating a section of a nursing home where elderly residents live, you will need to consult the nursing home staff to consider the possible consequences of isolation and to prepare a procedure. 
The following questions are useful: 
1 How will the isolation affect the staff and other personnel? For example, think about loss of power to lifts, heating and other essential systems. 
2 How could the isolation affect the residents and clients? For example, some residents may rely on oxygen, medical drips and ripple beds to aid circulation. These critical systems usually have battery back-up facilities for short durations. 
3 How could the isolation affect the members of the public? For example, fire alarms, nurse call systems, emergency lighting and other systems may stop working. 
4 How can an isolation affect systems? For example, IT programs and data systems could be affected; timing devices could be disrupted. In this scenario, you must make the employers, employees, clients, residents and members of the public aware of the planned isolation. 
Alternative electrical back-up supplies may be required in the form of generators or uninterruptable power supply systems. 
The main incoming electrical supply can be isolated at the consumer unit or distribution board. This component contains a main switch which will isolate all the power within a property. Each individual circuit will have its own miniature circuit breaker (MCB) and means of isolation allowing isolation of individual circuits such as lighting, sockets, cooker points, immersion heaters and appliances.

Figure 1.22 Distribution board 

. 
Figure 1.23 Switched fuse unit (left) and locked fuse (right) 



The electricity supply to appliances and components is usually provided by a fused spur, either switched or unswitched. These appliances can be isolated at this point by isolating and removal of the cartridge fuse. 


Safe isolation of electrical systems 
The following equipment is required to undertake the safe isolation of electrical systems: 
• 
a voltage indicator which has been manufactured and maintained in accordance with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Guidance Note GS38 

• 
a proving unit compatible with the voltage indicator 

• 
a lock and/or multi-lock system 

• 
warning notices which identify the work being carried out 

• 
relevant personal protective equipment (PPE) that adheres to all site PPE rules. 


Procedure 
1 Obtain permission to start work. In some environments a permit to work may be needed 2 Locate and identify circuit or equipment to be 
worked on 3 Identify means of isolation 4 Ensure isolation of circuit or equipment by 
switching off and: 
– 
withdrawing fuses 

– 
locking off 

– 
isolating switches or circuit breakers 

– 
fitting warning notice at point of isolation 




5 Select an approved test lamp or voltage indicating device 

. Figure 1.25 Voltage proving meter to indicate voltage

There are many implications of poor health and safety. 
For workers: 
• 
accidents (such as slips, trips and falls) and near misses 

• 
ill health 

• 
injuries 

• 
fatalities. 



For employers: 
• 
lower productivity 

• 
higher employee turnover 

• 
an unmotivated workforce 

• 
financial problems, for example due to higher insurance premiums or legal costs 

• 
damage to business reputation. 

For the general public: 

• 
accidents and near misses 

• 
ill health 

• 
injuries 

• 
fatalities 

• 
environmental issues. 


These implications are covered throughout this chapter. 
During the design and planning of a building or structure, it is important to consider the health, safety and welfare of workers undertaking the construction phase. However, it is equally important to plan for the protection of people carrying out routine inspections of the building or maintenance work. 

10.1 Reporting an incident or near miss in the workplace 
Workplace accidents and incidents must be reported to employers so that they can be properly dealt with and investigated to help develop potential solutions and reduce the risk of them reoccurring. 
Under the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1979, employers must record details of any workplace accident in an accident book. It is best to complete the entry as soon as possible after the accident has occurred, so that important information is not left out. 

By making reports and keeping records of accidents on site, it is possible to see patterns that may be emerging, possibly due to bad habits or incorrect work practices. These records can assist in planning future work activities to reduce the occurrence of accidents and may be used when legal matters arise related to an accident or emergency. Accident records can be requested and looked at by an employer’s insurance company, if a claim is made against them, or the HSE as part of an investigation into an accident or dangerous occurrence. The law states that employers must keep accident records for at least three years after the date they were completed. 
01_14 
. Figure 1.26 An accident book 
Employers have a duty to report the following to the HSE under RIDDOR: 
• 
the death of any person caused by a workplace accident 

• 
dangerous occurrences (also known as ‘near-miss accidents’) 



• 
gas incidents where someone has died, lost consciousness, or been taken to hospital for treatment 

• 
non-fatal accidents to non-workers, for example a member of the general public; however, this only needs to be reported if the person received treatment at hospital 


• occupational diseases: 
– 
asthma 

– 
cancer 

– 
carpal tunnel syndrome 

– 
dermatitis 

– 
disease attributed to exposure to a biological agent 

– 
hand–arm vibration syndrome 

– 
severe cramp of the forearm or hand 

– 
tendonitis of the forearm or hand 



• specified injuries caused by workplace accidents: 
– 
amputations 

– 
injuries arising from working in an enclosed space 

– 
any scalping requiring hospital treatment 

– 
crush injuries to the torso or head 

– 
fractures, other than to fingers, toes and thumbs 

– 
loss of consciousness caused by asphyxia or a head injury 

– 
permanent loss of sight or reduction in sight 

– 
serious burns (including scalding) 



• over seven consecutive days’ absences when a worker is unable to perform their duties as a result of a workplace accident. 
If an employee has been absent from work for three days as a result of an accident, it does not need to be reported to the HSE; however the employer must keep a record. A copy of a report in an accident book is usually sufficient. 

. Figure 1.27 A dangerous occurrence 


11.1 Procedures to follow in unsafe situations 
An emergency situation in the workplace can often result in delays with construction work, missed deadlines and additional costs for the principal contractor, not to mention the risk to workers’ lives. To reduce the potential impact of an unforeseen incident, employers have a duty under the CDM Regulations to plan for emergencies on construction sites as part of their pre-construction work. Under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, employers also have a duty to plan for emergencies on other sites such as offices, factories and warehouses. 

. Figure 1.28 A fire on a construction site 
Examples of unsafe or emergency situations in a workplace include: 
• 
fire, for example welding pipes using a blow torch providing a source of ignition 

• 
gas leaks, for example groundworks with a multi­purpose excavator causing damage to a buried gas pipe 

• 
terrorist threats, for example while undertaking construction work on government buildings 



• 
water leak, for example boring (drilling) into the ground and coming into contact with a mains water pipe 

• 
carbon monoxide, for example from a poorly installed or maintained boiler 

• 
electric shock, for example an operative cutting into a masonry wall with a disc cutter coming into contact with buried services such as electrical wires. 


As part of their health and safety preparations, an employer (as a responsible person) must nominate a competent person to make an emergency plan, complete a fire risk assessment and inform workers about the findings. 

Fire risk assessments are intended to identify fire hazards in a workplace and those at risk of harm. The level of risk should then be evaluated and a plan should be prepared by the responsible person. Where an employer has five or more employees, the fire risk assessment should be recorded. 
Workers on construction sites are usually informed about plans for emergencies and fire risk assessments during their site induction. The actions to follow are often reinforced on safety notices and information boards displayed in work areas. 
An emergency plan should be prepared at the start of every project and cover the following areas: 
• 
safe evacuation of the site in the event of an emergency 

• 
emergency escape routes 

• 
safety signage (for example directional signs and assembly points) 

• 
safe storage of hazardous and flammable materials, including waste 

• 
site security to minimise the risk of arson 

• 
assembly points and registers of workers on site 

• 
fire wardens 

• 
fire detection and alarms 

• 
designated spill kits to deal with hazardous chemical, fuel or oil spillages and leaks 

• 
training for workers on emergency equipment and fire safety (for example use of fire extinguishers, spill kits, and how to raise the alarm) 


25 

• 
procedures for calling the emergency services 

• 
emergency lighting 

• 
fire extinguishers 

• 
maintenance of escape routes and fire doors to keep them clear at all times 

• 
hot works permit systems 

• 
arrangements for smoking 

• 
arrangements for vehicles and plant, for example refuelling 

• 
emergency plant shut down and isolation to make processes safe. 





11.2 Actions to be taken when dealing with fire situations 
In the event of a fire in the workplace, workers must follow their employer’s procedures. The main steps in a fire procedure are outlined in Figure 1.30. 
Raise the alarm and inform others. 

Walk quickly, following the directional signs, to the closest available emergency exit. Make sure you close all the fire doors behind you. Do not use any lifts between floors. 

Only attempt to tackle a small fire if it is blocking your safe exit and if you are trained to use the equipment. 

Report to the assembly point and stay there until you are told to leave. 

Call the emergency services. 

. Figure 1.30 Fire procedure 
Employers should prepare for an emergency by practising evacuation procedures, without notice, to make sure everyone understands their roles to act promptly and appropriately. The control measures should be monitored, maintained and reviewed by the appointed person to make sure they are effective and do not deteriorate over time, for example a fire drill that is over-rehearsed could be disregarded by workers in a real emergency situation. 


11.3Fire extinguishers and their uses 
Fires need three elements to burn: 
• 
heat – such as a spark or naked flame 

• 
fuel – any material or substance that is combustible • oxygen – a gas that occurs naturally in the air. 


If all three are present, a fire is unavoidable. If one element is missing, a fire cannot occur. This is often referred to as the ‘fire triangle’. 
Fire extinguishers are designed to put out fire by removing one or more of these elements; however, if the wrong extinguisher is used, it could make the fire worse or increase the risk of harm. 
The fire risk assessment should identify the appropriate fire extinguishers for a workplace and where they should be situated (known as a fire point). They are usually placed close to exits and where there is an increased risk of a fire, for example hot works. 
Fires are classified according to the type of fuel that is burning: 
• 
Class A (flammable solids) – paper, cardboard, fabric 

• 
Class B (flammable liquids) – paints, adhesives, petrol 

• 
Class C (flammable gases) – liquid petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas 

• 
Class D (flammable metals) – magnesium, lithium, aluminium 

• 
Electrical (not classed as E because electrical fires are a source of ignition, not fuel) 

• 
Class F (cooking fats and oils) – chip pan or grease fires. 


The CDM Regulations state that everyone at work should be instructed on the safe use of fire extinguishers and understand the colour-coding system used to distinguish different types. All fire extinguishers should have a red body with a colour­coded panel to identify their content and the type of fire that they can safely be used to extinguish. 
Table 1.2 describes the range of fire extinguishers.

12.1 The purpose and correct use of PPE 
When the principles of prevention are applied to mitigate the risk of harm, personal protective equipment (PPE) is always considered a last resort because it only protects the user. Only after employers have considered all other methods of protecting their employees, for example eliminating or controlling risks at source, should they provide suitable PPE or respiratory protective equipment (RPE). 


Under the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at Work Regulations 1992, employers have legal duties to provide adequate information, instruction and training to their employees on the safe use of PPE. The law also states that employers should provide PPE free of charge, and that their employees should understand how to use and take care of it. 
PPE is a last line of defence and will only work properly if the correct type has been selected, it fits correctly and it is in good condition. Therefore, employees must: 
• 
wear PPE when instructed to do so by their employer 

• 
wear and adjust PPE correctly to work safely as trained 

• 
store PPE after use and maintain it 

• 
report any defects in, damage to or loss of PPE. 


If more than one item of PPE has to be worn at the same time, you must make sure that they are compatible with each other and that this does not affect the level of protection they provide. PPE that is uncomfortable to wear and does not suit the user can sometimes create further hazards, and discourage workers from using it. 
Table 1.3 illustrates types of PPE and the hazards they protect against. 
. Table 1.3 Types of PPE 

Body part protected  Hazards  Types of PPE  Correct use  
Ears  Noise  • Ear defenders • Ear muffs • Ear plugs • Canal caps/semi-insert ear plugs  Ear protection should reduce noise levels to an acceptable level, so that you are still able to communicate while wearing it. Ear protectors are manufactured with a single number rating (SNR) system, which  
allows the acoustic pressure on your ears to be calculated. For example, ear plugs with an SNR of 38 dB (decibels) will reduce a noise of 87 dB by 38 dB to a safe level of 49 dB. To put this into context, a hammer drill produces in excess of 100 dB. Disposable foam ear plugs should be fully inserted in the ear to work properly and disposed of after each use.  
Eyes  • Sparks • Dust • Chemicals • Debris  • Goggles • Safety spectacles • Face screens • Face shields • Full-face visors • Sunglasses  Eye protection should be compatible with other PPE worn, adjustable and stored correctly to prevent damage to the lenses.  
Feet and legs  • Slips • Falling objects • Objects penetrating the sole (for example nails sticking out of timber)  • Safety trainers, shoes, boots and wellingtons with toecaps and protective mid-soles • Chainsaw and foundry boots • Knee pads • Kneeling pads  Footwear should have a good grip for different surfaces, for example oil and mud, and be replaced when it becomes damaged. The risk assessment will identify which footwear should be worn.  
Hands and arms  • Cuts and abrasions • Impacts • Chemicals • Temperature extremes • Biological agents  • Anti-vibration gloves • Nitrile foam coated gloves • Gloves with cuffs • Gauntlets • Protective arm sleeves • Elbow pads  Care should be taken to select the correct type of gloves to protect against hazards. They must not create further risks, such as entanglement in machinery, when they are being used.  
Head and neck  • Falling objects • Hair entanglement • Chemicals • Adverse weather  • Hard hats • Bump caps • Snoods • Hair nets  PPE should be worn as directed by the manufacturer. In general, hard hats should be square on your head with the peak facing forwards. Avoid wearing caps or beanies underneath hard hats, unless they are designed for this. Avoid marking hats with paint or pens, because the chemicals damage them. Bump caps are no substitute for hard hats and should only be worn when there is a very low risk of bumping your head.  
Body part protected  Hazards  Types of PPE  Correct use  
Lungs (respiratory  • Dust  Respiratory protective  Masks should form a good seal around  
system)  • Vapours  equipment (RPE):  the user’s face to protect them properly.  
• Mists  • disposable half-mask  Employers often assess the performance  
• Gases  respirators  and suitability of masks provided for  
• Atmospheres with  • reusable half-mask  their employees by undertaking face-fit  
low or no oxygen  respirators with a filter  testing.  
• full-face mask respirators • powered respirators with a mask/hood or helmet • breathing apparatus (BA)  The type of masks and filters used should reflect the hazards. Employees should understand when and how to replace respirator filters.  
When masks are not in use, they should  
be stored correctly to prevent them  
being contaminated with hazardous  
substances.  
Whole body  • Chemicals • Temperature extremes • Adverse weather • Dust • Metal splashes  • Aprons • Overalls • Boiler suits • Chemical suits • High-visibility clothing  Whole-body protective equipment must be worn according to the manufacturer’s instructions and should not cause a risk of entanglement with equipment or machinery. Contaminated PPE should be cleaned or disposed of properly and never mixed with personal clothing.  

Emergency equipment may be required for those working near water, in confined spaces, at height or in oxygen-deficient atmospheres. This includes life jackets, safety harnesses, safety ropes and breathing apparatus. You must be trained in the safe use of emergency equipment and report any damage to it. 






13.1First-aid facilities that must be available in the work area 
The Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1981 place legal duties on all employers to provide adequate and appropriate first-aid equipment, facilities and people to assist their employees if they are injured or taken ill at work. To establish what is considered adequate and appropriate, employers must first carry out a workplace-specific first-aid assessment to determine their needs. 


. Figure 1.35 First-aid facilities on a construction site 
A first-aid assessment should take into consideration: 
• 
the nature of work being carried out and any specific hazards 

• 
the number of staff on site at any one time 

• 
the spread of the workforce 

• 
lone workers 

• 
the amount of first aiders and cover needed for holidays/absences 

• 
the number of first-aid boxes and their contents 

• 
first-aid resources needed, for example a first-aid room, stretcher and defibrillator 

• 
staff training, information and instruction. 



Employers responsible for work activities in low-risk environments have to provide a first-aid kit for their 
workers. They must also appoint a person to take charge of their first-aid arrangements, for example checking first-aid boxes are adequately stocked and calling the emergency services when necessary. 
In workplaces where there is a significant risk to employees’ health and safety, employers must also have a trained first aider. In the event of the first aider’s absence, due to any unforeseen circumstances, the appointed person should be able to provide emergency cover for them. 
The HSE publication ‘First aid at work’ recommends the contents of a basic first-aid box. However, an employer’s first-aid assessment will usually determine their exact needs. 
The first-aid equipment and facilities provided by employers should be kept clean and dry and made easily accessible. They should also be clearly signposted, in accordance with the Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996. 
Employers have a legal duty to inform their employees about their first-aid arrangements, including who their first aiders are, how to contact them and the location of the first-aid provision. This information is usually shared with workers when they first arrive at work, as part of their site or workplace induction. 






14.1 Categories of safety sign 
Safety signs and notices are often displayed around work areas and construction sites to convey important health and safety information. The Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996 categorise safety signs by their geometrical shape, colour and a simple pictogram. They may also be supported with supplementary text in the same colour as the sign. 
The main categories of safety sign are listed in Table 1.4. 
. Table 1.4 Categories of safety sign 
Type of safety sign  Description  
Mandatory  A circle with a blue background and white symbol or text Tells you that something must be done, for example eye protection must be worn  
Safe condition  A square or rectangle with a green background Shows directions to areas of safety and medical assistance in case of emergency  
Prohibition  A circle with a red outline and a red line from the top left to the bottom right Tells you that something must not be done, for example no smoking or no pedestrian access  
9781398332874_CH01.indd 33 08/02/22 1:10 PM 


. Table 1.4 Categories of safety sign

Warning  A yellow triangle with a black outline  

 Makes you aware of nearby danger  
Fire fighting  A red rectangle or square with a white pictogram

The law states that safety signs should only be used when there is a significant risk to health and safety that cannot be removed or controlled in other ways, or when they can reduce a risk further. If too many signs are displayed in close proximity to each other, they can cause confusion and the main points may be overlooked; therefore employers must select and position them carefully. 

. Table 1.5 CLP Regulations safety signs 


14.2 Symbols for hazardous waste 
Manufacturers, importers, distributors and other users of chemicals in the UK have legal duties under the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation 2010 to use appropriate safety signs for the classification, labelling and packaging of hazardous substances and waste. These signs are explained in Table 1.5.

Explosive  Explosive, self-reactive  Gas  


. Table 1.5 CLP Regulations safety signs 

Safety sign  Meaning  Encountered when using …  
Acute toxicity  • Toxic from single or multiple exposure • Toxic/fatal if swallowed, in contact with skin or inhaled  • Materials containing formaldehyde • Hazardous air pollutants  
Health hazard/hazardous to the ozone layer  • May cause respiratory, eye or skin irritation • May cause drowsiness or dizziness • Harmful if swallowed, inhaled or in contact with skin • Harms the environment by destroying the ozone layer  • Expanding foam • Grab adhesive • Wood adhesive • Solvent cement • Portland cement • Paint stripper  
Hazardous to the environment  Toxic to the surrounding natural environment, especially aquatic life  • Wood preservative • White spirit • Diesel, petrol and paraffin oils • Epoxy resin • Bitumen paint

The Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009 deal with potentially hazardous substances that are transported by road or rail. These regulations have a slightly different set of diamond-shaped safety signs, designed to suit their classifications of predominant hazards. 




15.1 Types of access equipment 
The HSE reported that 111 workers died as a result of falling from height in 2019–20 in the UK, and 40 of those people worked in the construction industry. 
If there is a risk of people falling any distance above or below ground that could result in an injury, the employer must take necessary precautions to eliminate the hazard completely or reduce the risk of harm to an acceptable level by assessing the risks. 
Where a risk remains, employers should use equipment or other measures to minimise the distance and consequences of a fall, for example safety nets or air bags, or PPE such as a safety harness and lanyard. In the event of an accident, employers should have a well­rehearsed plan and equipment designed to rescue and evacuate people from height. 

Equipment specifically designed for working safely at height is referred to as access equipment. It should only be used by trained, competent and authorised people in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Ladders 

Ground side slope should not exceed 16°; ground should be clean and free of slippery algae and moss 
. Figure 1.37 Ladder 
A ladder should be: 
• 
set at an angle of 75° or a ratio of 1:4 (the distance between the wall and the base of the ladder should be one quarter of the ladder’s height) 

• 
placed on firm, level ground 

• 
placed against a stable surface 

• 
extended 1 m above a working platform 

• 
secured to prevent slipping/moving 

• 
used for light work and short durations. 


The user should have three points of contact with the ladder at all times and never overreach.

Staging boards 

Staging boards are designed to create a safe working platform between two supports, with guard rails on one or both sides. 
You should never exceed the safe working load of staging boards with materials and people. 
Mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) 

people that supply the access equipment, for example employers and hire companies. A tagging system may be adopted, with tags attached to different types of access equipment as a way of recording inspections and identifying when it is safe to use. 


. Figure 1.44 Boom and scissor lift 
There are a number of different types of mobile elevating work platform, each one designed for access, safety and work at height. Only suitably trained, experienced and competent workers should operate a MEWP. 
15.2 Safety checks on access equipment 
Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (PUWER) 1998, employers must ensure that access equipment is suitable for its intended use, safe and well maintained. 
They must also regularly inspect the components of access equipment for signs of wear and damage, to ensure they have not deteriorated. Records should be kept of weekly, monthly and annual inspections by the 
01_33 

. Figure 1.45 A tag on access equipment 
Some work equipment may be subject to other regulations which have specific requirements regarding inspections, such as LOLER. Scaffolding, for example, should be inspected before use and every seven days after that. However, further inspections may be necessary if there has been adverse weather or an accident/incident. 
Daily visual pre-use inspections of access equipment should be completed by competent employees, to ensure there are no defects and the equipment is safe to use. These inspections should include checking that the non-slip feet on ladders and step ladders are not missing or damaged, and the stiles, steps and rungs are not bent or missing. Even the smallest amount of damage to access equipment can compromise its strength; therefore it should always be reported as soon as possible and damaged equipment should never be used. 

15.3 Selecting access equipment 
Access equipment must be appropriate for the work intended. This will be determined by the risk assessment and method statement, not its availability and cost. 
Before working at any height, employers must consider the safest way to complete the task, its duration and the frequency with which access equipment will be used. 
Other points to consider when selecting access equipment include: 
• 
whether it is for internal or external use 

• 
the ground conditions, for example uneven, sloped or soft 

• 
the weather conditions, for example high winds or snow/ice 

• 
safe access and egress 

• 
the height at which it will be used 

• 
the space needed for people and materials 

• 
how materials and equipment will be loaded onto it 

• 
the weight it will carry 

• 
nearby hazards, for example overhead power lines and fragile roofs 

• 
the type of work being undertaken 

• 
training, information, instruction and supervision. 


The risk of a fall from ladders and steps is relatively high; therefore they should only be used for a short duration and no longer than 30 minutes at a time. If this is not possible, the risk must be reduced by using a safer type of equipment, such as a podium. 
Certain types of access equipment have action points for heights; for example a tower scaffold needs outriggers to support the equipment when it exceeds heights specified in the manufacturer’s instructions. Further advice and guidance on the safe use of access equipment can be found on the HSE website. 


15.4Manual handling operations 
Manual handling is defined as any lifting, carrying, supporting or moving of a load using bodily force. Employees working in the construction industry will inevitably be involved in carrying out manual handling operations and therefore have an increased risk of an injury or chronic muscular damage. These types of injury are referred to as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and affect different parts of the body, including the back, shoulders, arms, legs, feet and toes. The HSE reported in the year 2019–20 that half a million people were suffering with a new or existing work-related musculoskeletal disorder, and this figure does not include workers who have not reported injuries under RIDDOR. 

Where employees are expected to undertake manual handling operations in the workplace, their employers must take reasonably practicable measures to protect them from harm. The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 state that this should be done by: 
• 
avoiding carrying out manual handling if possible – consider completing the task another way, for example with a forklift, telehandler or crane 

• 
assessing the hazards when it is not possible to avoid manual handling activities by completing a suitable and sufficient manual handling risk assessment 

• 
reducing the risk as much as is reasonably practicable. 


If this is not possible, workers should use good kinetic lifting techniques or be provided with mechanical lifting aids, such as a pallet truck or sack truck. Where this is not possible, consider changes to the task, load and working environment. 


. Figure 1.46 Safe manual handling sequence for a single person 
Manual handling injuries often occur because activities are badly performed or planned. Employers have a duty to make sure their workers have the necessary information, instruction and training. They must consider the following points when assessing manual handling activities: 
• Task: 
– 
What does the task involve? 

– 
Does the task involve more than one person? 

– 
How far will the load have to be carried? 

– 
How often will the task take place? 


• Individual: 
– Is the worker physically and mentally able to carry out the task? 
– 
Does the worker have the necessary knowledge to complete the task safely? 

– 
Has the worker received the necessary training? 

– 
Does the worker have the right PPE, for example gloves or footwear with a good grip? 



• 
Load: 

– 
Consider the size, shape, weight, centre of gravity and temperature of the load. 

– 
Is the load sharp? 

– 
Is the load likely to move? 



• 
Environment: 

– 
Consider the weather and ground conditions. 

– 
Will the route be clear or are there likely to be obstructions or obstacles, such as stairs or scaffolding?

. Figure 1.48 Examples of mechanical lifting aids: a pallet truck (left) and a sack truck (right) 
Employees have a legal duty to follow their employer’s safe system of work, to protect themselves and others from the risk of injury from manual handling operations. They must also use lifting equipment and machinery provided by their employer, if they are trained to use it, and report any unsafe conditions they identify to their supervisor as soon as possible. 

16.1 Dangers associated with excavations 
Excavations are often created on construction sites to form trenches and holes for building foundations, or to gain access to underground services and drainage. Pedestrians, materials and vehicles are all at risk of falling into exposed excavations unless satisfactory preventative measures are taken to keep them at a safe distance. 
Working in an excavation can be extremely dangerous because of the risk of flooding or collapse causing people to be crushed. There could be reduced levels of oxygen and poisonous or explosive atmospheres. 
Excavations are most likely to fail if they are too deep and unsupported, or if the soil conditions are weak. The walls of an excavation may also become unstable if there is vibration in the ground caused by vehicle movement around the site or nearby public roads. Additionally, they can weaken and collapse if the soil of an excavation dries out in hot weather, expands after a heavy frost or becomes saturated with rain water. 


Plant operators must be competent and take precautions while excavating with machinery to ensure they do not come into contact with buried services, such as gas pipes or live electricity cables. Special care should also be taken when digging next to adjacent structures and buildings, to make sure they are not disturbed or undermined, causing them to become unstable or collapse. 
If the construction site has previously been used for manufacturing, industrial or agricultural purposes, the soil may have been contaminated with hazardous waste or chemicals that have been buried or have naturally occurred in the ground. 
Under the CDM Regulations, the client has a duty to provide information to the contractor about the location of buried services, any underground structures or any other relevant information before work starts on site. This will allow the contractor to prepare a pre-construction health and safety plan, reducing the risk of an accident or dangerous occurrence. 

. Figure 1.50 A plant operator 
16.2 Safety when working in excavations 
All excavations should be individually planned and carried out in a safe way by competent workers and supervisors. Wherever possible, working in an excavation should be avoided and only considered as a last resort. 
Employers have a duty to reduce the likelihood of an accident or injury in an excavation by assessing the risks and introducing control measures such as the following: 
• 
Isolate the hazard by erecting suitable edge protection barriers, for example Heras-style fencing (temporary metal fence panels), to prevent unauthorised access and to protect the general public. 

• 
Install ‘stop blocks’ a safe distance away from the excavation to prevent vehicles getting too close and reduce the risk of hazardous exhaust fumes entering the excavation. 

• 
Display safety signs and notices to raise awareness of the hazards and the precautions to be taken. 

• 
Provide adequate lighting. 

• 
Provide safe access (entry) to and egress (exit) from the excavation, for example using ladders or temporary stairs. 

• 
Use a temporary support system to prevent the excavation from collapsing, for example a trench box (metal sidewalls held apart with struts). 

• 
Provide safe designated crossing points. 

• 
Test the soil for contamination. 

• 
Adopt a permit-to-work system to dig and work in the excavation. 

• 
Provide adequate ventilation to workers in the excavation. 

• 
Identify and protect exposed services. 

• 
Carry out daily inspections of the excavation. 

• 
Ensure a competent person carries out atmospheric testing at various points within the excavation before anyone enters, at the start of each shift and after breaks, and continuously thereafter if indicated by the risk assessment and permit to work. Personal monitors may also be worn by individuals working in the excavation. 

• 
Use appropriate portable gas-detection equipment. 

• 
Ensure good communication methods between workers in the excavation and the supervisor. 

• 
Put in place a rescue plan to recover an injured person and provide appropriate rescue equipment. 




. Figure 1.51 A trench box supporting an excavation 
16.3 Dangers associated with confined spaces 
The definition of a confined space is a workplace which may be substantially but not always entirely enclosed, where there is a foreseeable serious risk of injury because of the conditions or from hazardous substances. Excavations, loft spaces, sewers or wells could be described as confined spaces, because they are enclosed with restricted access and egress. 
Confined spaces may already contain hazards, such as a lack of oxygen or a risk of an explosion. Hazards can also be created by workers with electrical equipment, machinery, materials and substances such as petrol and solvents. Some confined spaces may also contain toxic atmospheres created by gases such as naturally occurring methane, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are particularly dangerous because they are colourless, odourless and tasteless, making them more difficult to detect without specialist testing equipment. 
The air we breathe contains a mixture of different gases, with oxygen making up about 21 per cent. If the oxygen in the atmosphere is reduced just below this level, it affects our ability to function normally; if depleted further to 6 per cent or below, it will result in almost certain death. 
Additional hazards that may be found in confined spaces include: 
• 
fire 

• 
extremes of heat and cold 

• 
dust, fumes and vapours 

• 
flooding resulting in drowning 

• 
free-flowing solids causing suffocation, for example sand 

• 
entrapment. 




16.4 Safety when working in confined spaces 
The Confined Spaces Regulations 1997 state that working in a confined space should be avoided wherever possible, and work should be completed in another way without entering the space. If this cannot be done and there is still a significant risk of injury, then the work must be properly planned and organised with appropriate control measures in place before it starts. 

The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 state that employers and the self­employed must complete a suitable and sufficient risk assessment for work in a confined space. This is used to identify hazards and determine what precautions need to be taken to reduce the risk of injury. It will also help employers to prepare a safe system of work. 
Everyone involved in working in a confined space must be competent and specifically trained to undertake their tasks. This includes managers, supervisors and emergency personnel. 
If a permit-to-work system is adopted, it would limit the number of people and time spent in a confined space and safely control work activities. Before a permit is issued, workers are told about: 
• 
the risks to health and safety and how to control them 

• 
methods used to communicate from the inside to their supervisor or sentry on the outside 

• 
how to raise the alarm in an emergency 

• 
testing and monitoring of the atmosphere 

• 
PPE or RPE to be worn 

• 
arrangements to recover them from the confined space if necessary (a rescue plan).

Imagine a job building a house where the carpenter measures everything in inches, the plumber measures in centimetres, the bricklayer uses feet, and the electrician uses metres. What do you think the outcome would be? 
Equally, in science, if someone performed a calculation using one unit of measurement, and another person used a different unit, they would produce different results which could lead to confusion. 
As a result, the International System of Units, known as SI units, was introduced. The system sets out what units of measurement, symbols and indices are used to calculate quantities. 
Before we look at the SI units, it would be a good idea to understand what indices are. Indices are used to replace repetitive multiplications. For example, 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000. This calculation can be written easily as 103, which means ten multiplied by itself three times, or three lots of ten multiplied together. 
Where indices are negative, the value becomes a fraction, because the value moves to the right of the decimal point, becoming smaller. For example: 
1
-1
5 or 0.2

x2 button to square a number, and scientific calculators also have an 
xy 
button, which allows a number to be raised to any power or index. For example, to calculate 55, use buttons 
5
 3125. This is much easier than keying 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 into a calculator. 
Generally, in construction science and principles, large values are used, such as thousands of watts or millions of joules. Other aspects of building services engineering or construction work deal with tiny amounts, such as millionths of a metre or thousandths of an ohm. This can become a problem in calculations, as errors may occur if the correct number of zeros is not entered into the calculator. 
Instead of inserting the actual number with lots of zeros, we use ‘to the power of ten’. 

The ‘power of’ numbers are given names that are explained in Table 2.1. There is less chance of making an error using this method.

SI units are broken down into two different categories: 
• 
base SI units 

• 
derived SI units. 


Base SI units are the main category used, whereas derived units require the base functions to determine them. Base SI units are shown in Table 2.2. 

. Table 2.2 Base SI units

Length  metre (m)  l  
Time  second (s)  t  
Temperature  kelvin (K)  T  
Electric current  ampere (A)  l  
Luminous intensity  candela (cd)  l  

Note: the amount of a substance in moles is also a base unit but not relevant to the subjects in this book. 

As well as knowing the base SI units of measurement, you may be required to carry out simple calculations using them. 
Calculations using base SI units obtain other values called derived SI units. For example, length multiplied by width of a rectangle gives the rectangle’s area (or m × m = m2). 

There are many derived SI units of measurement. Table 2.3 shows those relevant to construction-based activities, including the formulae used to calculate them.

Other environmental effects on materials to consider in more detail include: 
• 
electrolytic and galvanic corrosion (metals) 

• 
dissimilar metals 



• 
thermal expansion 

• 
UV radiation. 


Electrolytic and galvanic corrosion (metals) 
This is a chemical reaction where two metals are separated by an electrolyte which causes one metal to corrode at an accelerated rate. Without suitable protection, these types of corrosion can cause structural parts of a building to fail. 
Electrolytic corrosion occurs where electrical current is induced into nearby metals from other influences, such as buried high-voltage cables. This causes a voltage difference between the metals, which in turn creates a circuit. As current is a flow of electrons, the electrons from one metal are drawn to the other, which means the metal is losing electrons and corroding. The electrolyte is whatever is between the two metals, such as soil or clay, and allows electric current to flow through it. 
Galvanic corrosion is where two dissimilar metals are in close proximity and separated by an electrolyte or the two metals are touching. If one metal is more chemically active than the other, such as stainless steel to zinc, the proximity is similar to creating a battery and this causes current to flow between them, which again results in loss of electrons and corrosion. 

Dissimilar metals 
Although two dissimilar metals in close proximity can cause electrolytic or galvanic corrosion, by carefully selecting the two metals we can use their different properties – such as thermal expansion – to an advantage. 
By fixing two dissimilar metals together, such as iron and brass, a bimetallic strip is created. When the metals are heated, one expands more than the other and this causes them both to bend. 
Figure 2.1 shows how this process can be used in a heat-controlled switch, such as a thermostat controlling room temperature for a cooling system. When the room gets too hot, the metal bends, closing the switch which activates the cooling system. 
Electric 



wire 



. Figure 2.1 Bimetallic strip used as a heat-operated switch, such as in a thermostat (top: in normal state; bottom: when heat is applied and the strip bends) 
Thermal expansion 
Different materials expand at different rates. This can cause failure of building structures and services if correct measures are not taken. 
One example is PVC conduit used to protect electric cables. It is usually fixed to a wall using saddles. The amount of expansion, in metres, for PVC conduit is, on average, 52 × 10-6 for every metre length of conduit, per °C rise in temperature (52 × 10-6 m/m/°C). This is known as its linear temperature expansion coefficient. 
If a 6 m run of conduit was installed at 20°C but the temperature of the space was increased to 45°C (as might occur in a loft space), by how much would it expand? 
-6
52 × 10 × 6 m ×(45 - 20 ) 0.0078 m or 7.8 mm 

If the conduit was installed without taking the expansion into consideration, the additional 7.8 mm would cause it to bend between supports, making it look wavy instead of straight. 


As a result, PVC conduit systems should have expansion couplers evenly spaced in the installation to provide a space for the conduit to expand into and stop it from buckling or waving. 
Space allowance for expansion

. Figure 2.2 PVC conduit with expansion coupler to stop it buckling 
Concrete and steel expand at similar rates. If they did not, many structures made of concrete and reinforced with steel would crumble, with one material expanding more quickly than the other. 
Other linear temperature expansion coefficients for common materials are shown in Table 2.6.

Steel  10–12 × 10-6  
Wood across its grain  30 × 10-6  
Wood along its grain  3 × 10-6  

Ultra-violet(UV)radiation 
Ultra-violet (UV) radiation comes from direct sunlight and can cause some plastic-based materials such as white PVC to degrade. 

The radiation breaks down polymers in the plastic which normally allow it to be flexible. When the polymers break down, the plastic becomes brittle and can break easily. This is why white PVC pipes or cables should never be used outdoors in direct sunlight. 
Some plastics are specially treated to withstand UV radiation, such as black plastics. This is why most outdoor plastic pipes are black or grey. Unplasticised PVC (uPVC) is also UV resistant and is commonly used as a plastic material where white colouring and strength are required, such as for guttering or windows and window sills. 

It is important to understand the ways in which mechanical loads are measured. You need to know the difference between mass and weight, as well as energy and power. Energy and power can be mechanical as well as electrical. 
The fundamental relationship between mass and weight is defined by Newton’s second law. According to this law: 
Fma 

where: 
• 
F = force (N) 

• 
m = mass (kg) 

• 
a = acceleration (m/s2). 


Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object. It is not dependent on gravity and is therefore different (but proportional) to weight. 
Weight is the downwards gravitational force acting on a mass. Newton’s second law can be transformed to express weight as a force by replacing acceleration (a) with acceleration due to gravity (g): 
W  mg 

where: 
• 
W = weight (N) 

• 
m = mass (kg) 

• 
g = acceleration due to gravity (on Earth, this is 9.81 m/s2). 



4.1Acceleration 
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time: 
v 
a t 
where: 
• 
a = acceleration (m/s2) 

• 
.v = change in velocity (m/s) 

• 
t = time (s). 


As acceleration is a measurement of the rate of change of speed in metres per second (m/s) each second (s), the unit is metres per second per second, or metres per second squared (m/s2). 


4.2How levers work 
Levers are tools that exert a large force when applying a lesser force. They come in all shapes and sizes, such as crowbars, claws on claw hammers, wheelbarrows or even seesaws in playgrounds. 
While levers give an advantage in terms of the force applied, the distance travelled is increased, meaning the energy used is essentially the same. This is because the turning moments (torque) applied to the ends of a lever must be equal but opposite. Therefore: 
force × distance  force × distance 
Torque is measured in newton-metres (Nm). This is the product of the force (N) applied to a lever and the distance (m) of the force from the fulcrum. 

Levers are categorised into three classes. 
Class 1 levers 
In a class 1 lever, the force and the load are on different sides of the fulcrum. The effectiveness of the force depends on its distance from the fulcrum; the greater the distance, the greater the effect of the force. 

In Figure 2.3, the force applied downwards can be four times less than the load, as the lever on the force (effort) side of the fulcrum is four times longer than the lever on the load side. 
400 N 100 N (load) (effort) 

0.5 m 
2 m 

Fulcrum 

. Figure 2.3 Class 1 lever 
Examples of class 1 levers are seesaws, crowbars and claw hammers when used to lift nails. The advantage gained by a lever is referred to as mechanical advantage (MA), which is calculated as: 
loadMA effort 

So, for the lever in Figure 2.3, the mechanical advantage is: 
400 
4
100 

Class 2 levers 
In a class 2 lever, the load is between the force and the fulcrum. 
The calculations remain the same, but the load is more limited because it is between the two points, and the force and the desired movement are both in the same direction. An example of a class 2 lever is a wheelbarrow. 


2.5 m 


500 N (load) 100 N (effort) 
0.5 m 


Fulcrum 
. Figure 2.4 Class 2 lever 
In the example in Figure 2.4, the force of effort of 100 N is applied 2.5 m from the fulcrum, and the load is applied 0.5 m from the fulcrum. 
The load that can be lifted is calculated as follows: 
force of load × distance from fulcrumf mforce of effort × distance from fulcrum 
Therefore, the force of the load in Figure 2.4 can be calculated by: 
force of load × 0.5 m 100 N × 2.5 m 
This can then be represented as: 
100 N × 2.5 m
force of load 500 N 


0.5 m 
Class 3 levers 
In a class 3 lever, the force is between the load and the fulcrum. Examples of class 3 levers include fishing rods, tweezers, tongs and the human arm. 
The advantage with class 3 levers is not so much the effort needed, but the distance travelled.

4.3Pulleys 
A pulley is an effective way of gaining a mechanical advantage when lifting an object. By running a rope through a four-pulley system, a mechanical advantage of four is gained. 

. Figure 2.6 A pulley system lifting a mass of 1000 kg against gravity 

Looking at Figure 2.6, we can determine the force required to raise the mass of 1000 kg. As the load has been described as a mass, first determine the downward force of the load: 
force  mass × gravity 
f 1000 × 9.81 9810 N 

Remember: gravity is acceleration, which averages 9.81 m/s2. 
As the system has four pulleys compared to one pulling rope, the mechanical advantage is 4:1. 
Remember: 
loadMA effort 

Rearrange the formula for mechanical advantage to find the effort required: 
loadeffort MA 
9810 2452 N 
4 

Therefore, a downward force (or effort) of 2452.5 N is required to raise the load. 
Although the pulley gives a mechanical advantage, the pulling rope will need to be pulled four times further than the load is raised. This means to raise the load by 1 m, the pulling rope needs to be pulled 4 m. 


4.4Work 
If the force applied to a body results in movement, then work has been done. This applies to forces that lift, push or twist objects. 
When an object moves in the same direction as the force exerted, the work done is equal to the force exerted multiplied by the distance moved: 
work force × distance 

Or, to include the values used to determine force: 
work mass× gravity× distance 

Mechanical work is measured in joules (J). (Newton­metres (Nm) can be used for mechanical work, but are also used as a measurement for torque.) Other units of work or energy, which are not SI units but commonly used for specific applications, include: 
• 
kilowatt hour (kWh), used by electricity supply companies to measure electrical energy 

• 
calorie, often used as a measure of food energy 

• 
BTU (British Thermal Unit), often used for heat source applications such as burning gas. 



Let us work through an example. If a mass of 100 kg is lifted 10 m, calculate the work done: 
Forceweight m ×=100 ×9.81 981 N a 
Work done forcedistance× 981 ×10 9810 J 
If the mass is doubled, the work done is: 
Forceweight ma 200 ×9.81
×= 
1962 N or 1.962 kN 
Work done forcedistance× 1962 × 10 19620 J 
Energy can exist in many forms but is categorised into two main groups: 
• 
kinetic energy (the energy an object has due to its motion, such as a rotating machine) 

• 
potential energy (stored energy held by an object because of its position or state, for example a coiled spring). 


The potential energy of gravity keeps a mass on the ground. If the mass is raised, then a machine uses kinetic energy. If the input of kinetic energy ceases, the potential energy tries to bring the mass back down to the ground. 


4.5Power 
Power is defined as the rate of doing work. It is calculated by dividing work done by the time taken to carry out that work: 
work done 
average power time taken 

The unit of power is joules per second (J/s), and 1 J/s is equivalent to 1 watt (W). 
The output (mechanical) power required for a motor to raise a mass of 1000 kg to a height of 5 m above the ground in one minute is calculated as: 
mad
××
P t 

So: 
1000 × 9.81 × 5
P 817.5 W
60 

If the same motor raised the same load in 10 seconds, the output power required by the motor would be: 
1000 × 9.81 × 5
P 4905 W
10 

The amount of energy used is the same, no matter how quickly the task is carried out, but more power is required to do the work in a shorter time. 


4.6Efficiency 
The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. However, during the transformation process, some of the energy may be turned into unwanted forms, such as noise or heat, known as energy losses. Such losses are common in mechanical processes. 
The efficiency of a mechanical system is the ratio of output power compared to input power expressed as a percentage: 
output power 
% efficiency × 100
input power 


It is more common for efficiency to be expressed in terms of power rather than energy, although energy could replace power in this formula. 
If a machine with a 200 kW output has an input power of 220 kW, the machine efficiency is: 
200
% efficiency × 100 90.9%
220 

As well as occurring in mechanical systems such as machines, losses in efficiency can also occur in specific BSE systems: 
• 
Electrical systems: the passage of an electric current represents a flow of power or energy. When current flows in a circuit, power loss occurs in the conductors due to resistance. This causes heat dissipation and voltage drop, which are also losses. 

• 
Heating systems: pipework can lose heat. Long systems can dissipate a lot of heat if measures such as lagging are not used. Pipe systems with small diameters or many bends can also lose pressure, meaning more power is required to pump fluids through the system. 

• 
Forced air systems: these can lose pressure if ducting contains many bends or reduced diameters, which in turn will require more power to force the air through. 




4.7 Centre of gravity 
The centre of gravity of an object is an imaginary point where the weight of the object is concentrated. 
Figure 2.7 shows a uniform object, where the centre of gravity is in the centre of the object. If a pivot is placed under the centre of gravity, the object remains balanced, but if the pivot is placed under any other part of the object, the object is unstable and falls. 
When lifting or manually handling, it is easier to carry an object if it is supported under the centre of gravity. This state, where the object is perfectly balanced, is known as equilibrium. 
Centre of gravity 


Centre of gravity over the pivot means the object remains balanced

If the centre of gravity is moved away from the pivot, the object falls or becomes unstable 
. Figure 2.7 Effects of centre of gravity 

4.8Moments or torque 
Torque is a term often used in building services and mechanics. It refers to how tight something needs to be, such as a nut, bolt or screw. Too tight and it may break the thread or snap, not tight enough and it may come loose. 

. Figure 2.8 A torque screwdriver with adjustable settings 
Torque, or moment, is measured in Newton metres (Nm) and determined by:

0.15 m: 
Moment or torque 50 N × 0.15 m 7.5 Nm 

4.9Archimedes’ principle of displacement 
Archimedes’ principle relates to how fluid is displaced by an object placed in it. It states that an upwards buoyant force exerted on an object immersed or partly immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. If the weight of the fluid displaced is equal to or greater than the weight of the object, the object will float; if the object is heavier, it will sink. 


Figure 2.10 shows a body of fluid before a weight is placed into it. The 500 kg weight displaces 400 kg of water, so the object sinks. But when a 300 kg object displaces 400 kg of water, the object floats due to the buoyant forces acting on it. 
500 kg 


. Figure 2.10 When an object is heavier than the displaced fluid, the object sinks; when it is lighter, it floats 

Whichever career path you take in construction, you will work on or near electricity, particularly in building services engineering. Knowing basic electrical principles will help you to work safely. 
There are three key areas for delivering an electrical supply to an installation: 
• 
generation 

• 
transmission 

• 
distribution. 



5.1Generation 
Electricity can be generated in many ways due to a large-scale move towards renewable resources. The use of fossil fuels in the UK is now in decline, due to the need to protect the environment, although they are better suited to times of peak demand. 
Peak demand refers to times when consumer demand for electricity is at its highest, for example on cold, dark days when more heat and light are needed. Another example would be at half-time during a big televised football match, when large numbers of people boil a kettle to make tea. 
Fossil-fuel sources 
Fossil fuels all work in the same way. Fuel is burned, which heats water to form high-pressure steam. This steam turns a turbine, which rotates a generator at high speeds to produce electricity. 
Fossil fuels are not renewable. They are very polluting and release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases when burned, leading to climate change. 

Gas 
Gas is the most widely used fossil fuel. It can produce instant heat, so gas generators can heat water to steam much more quickly than coal generators. 
While its use is in decline, due to the need to reduce greenhouse gases produced when it is burned, it remained the largest energy source in the UK in 2021. Location of the power plant is not critical, as gas can be piped to most mainland areas of the UK. 
Oil 
Oil is used for many regional generators, which power local areas at times of peak demand. The generators can deliver electricity immediately. 
Oil is also used for private standby generators, for buildings such as hospitals that require a continuous power supply during mains power cuts. 
Traditionally, oil-fired power stations are located near coastal oil refineries, to minimise transportation of the oil. 

Coal 
Coal used to be the most widely used fuel to produce high-pressure steam for turbines. However, it is highly polluting and its use has therefore been scaled down in the UK, with only a few coal-fired power stations remaining. Most of these are only used during periods of peak demand. Coal-fired power stations were traditionally located near to UK sources of coal, such as South Wales, Yorkshire and the North East of England. 

In 2017, the UK went 24 hours without using a single coal-fired power station, for the first time since 1882. In 2020, the entire summer months went without coal being burned. This is a huge step forward in reducing pollution and climate change. 
Renewable fuel sources 
Wind 
Wind power turns a propeller, which directly drives a generator. Wind is a natural resource, so no pollution is created or resources are required after production of the turbine. 
The use of wind energy is ideal for the UK, as an island with a lot of wind from the sea. Electricity generation from wind power is increasing each year, with many offshore wind farms being constructed several miles out to sea. 
Wave 
The sea produces a huge amount of energy, both in the form of waves and as the tide moves in and out each day. This movement of water can be used to turn electrical generators through a rotating waterwheel effect or using a back-and-forth motion. 

Hydro 
There are three types of hydro generation: 
• 
Run of river: this uses the natural downward flow of rivers and harnesses the water’s energy by using existing weirs. 

• 
Storage: watercourses are held back by a dam and released through pipes that divert the water through turbines. 

• 
Pumped storage: a large volume of water is held in a reservoir high up on hills or mountains until needed. When there is high demand for electricity, the water is released from the reservoir through turbines. When the station is offline, the water is pumped back up to the reservoir, ready for the next time it is needed. 




Photovoltaic 
Photovoltaic (PV) cells convert solar energy into electricity without any moving parts. You can see these on the roofs of some houses and in fields called solar farms. 

Electricity is generated at power stations using a three-phase system. A three-phase system is one where the rotation of the generator is used to maximum effect by having three windings, so one turn of the generator gives three times the current distributed over three wires. A single-phase generator would only distribute current in one wire with a neutral return path. This means much of the magnetic field is unused during one revolution of a large generator. To maximise output, most generators are three-phase, with only small-scale portable generators being single-phase. 
5.2Transmission systems 
In the UK, the transmission system is called the National Grid. It is a network of mainly overground cables used to send electricity all around the UK from the generator stations. As transmission systems are hundreds of miles long and send vast amounts of electrical power, they use a range of very high voltages: 
• 
400 kV (known as the super grid) • 275 kV • 132 kV. 

There are two main reasons why high voltages are used: 

• 
High voltages mean reduced current, so smaller conductor sizes can be used. 

• 
As the cables travel vast distances, the voltage lost due to cable resistance has less of an impact on high voltages than it would on lower voltages. 


As an example, a locality consumes 80 MW of electricity. Calculate the current demand at 400kV and 400 V. 

To calculate the current demand based on power and voltage values, use: 
P
I 
V 

So, at 400 kV and remembering that 80 MW is 80 × 106 watts: 
6
80 × 10 200 A 400000 

So, the cables need to be big enough to carry 200 A to the area of demand. 
To calculate the current demand at 400 V, the same process is used, so: 
6
80 × 10 
200000 A or 200 kA 
400 

At this level of current, the cables would need to be huge. The benefit of increasing the voltage is to reduce the current, making cable sizes much more realistic. 
Where cables have resistance (see section 5.5), this resistance leads to power loss in the form of voltage drop. The amount of voltage drop is directly proportional to the amount of current and the value of resistance as: 
voltage drop current × resistance 

So, if a section of transmission cable had a resistance of 20 . and carried a current of 200 A, the voltage drop would be: 
200 × 20 4000 V 


There are issues with transmitting at higher voltages: 
• 
High voltages can break down insulation. When cables are overground, air is used as an insulator between conductors. In underground cables, materials such as PVC are used as insulators between conductors. 

• 
Conductors need to be suspended high above the ground and several metres away from each other, as high voltages can jump across or break down air, especially when the air has a high water content 


(i.e. relative humidity). 
The towers used to carry electricity cables are known as pylons. The higher the voltage used in the transmission system, the bigger the pylons must be. Pylons used for the 400 kV super grid are as high as a tower block and have six cables suspended from them (three on each side). There is a single cable running between the tops of pylons, which acts as a common earth. 
Transformers are used to change voltages within the transmission system, by either stepping up the voltage (for example from 132 kV to 400 kV) or stepping it down. If voltage is increased, current will decrease; if voltage is decreased, current will increase. This relates to the number of primary (input) windings in the transformer compared with the number of secondary (output) windings, shown by: 
NVI
p ps 
NVI
s sp 

All transmission voltages are three-phase, so the transformers used to step up or step down the voltage in the transmission system need to be three-phase as well. This means they have three incoming wires into three windings, which step up or step down the voltage into three outgoing wires. 
Where transmission systems enter urban areas or pass through the countryside but need to be hidden, they may need to run underground. In this case, the voltage will be stepped down (for example to 132 kV) so it does not damage the insulation between the conductors in the underground cable. 


5.3 Distribution systems 
At points around the National Grid, electricity is tapped off to be distributed to the user. These systems are known as distribution systems. They are looked after by distribution network operators (DNOs). 
As distribution is much more localised, the voltages can be stepped down to lower values. This keeps the pylon sizes smaller. Lower voltages mean cables in urban areas can be run underground, keeping the supplies invisible. As underground systems are more expensive, rural areas normally use cheaper overhead supplies. 
Depending on how far the electricity needs to be distributed, distribution voltages may be: 
• 
33 kV (three-phase) 

• 
11 kV (three-phase) 

• 
400 V (three-phase) 

• 
230 V (single-phase). 


In most cases, the underground cables in towns and cities are 11 kV. These supply the many substation transformers. 

On the outgoing side of the substation (to consumers’ installations), the supplies are 400 V three-phase or 230 V single-phase, depending on overall current demand. As a general rule: 
• 
buildings with a demand over 100 A will have a three-phase supply 

• 
buildings with a demand below 100 A will have a single-phase supply.

5.4 Basic electrical circuit principles 
Electricity is the flow of electrons from one atom to another. Materials that are good conductors have electrons which move out of orbit from atom to atom. When the material is connected to an electromotive force (emf) such as a battery, the flow can be controlled in one direction. This is because the electrons are attracted to the positive plate of the battery. 
This flow of electrons is called charge and happens in materials that are good conductors, such as copper, iron and steel. 
Materials whose atoms keep their electrons in orbit make good insulators, such as rubber or PVC. 
What makes materials or elements different is the structure of their atoms. The number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is different for different types of material. For example, copper has 29 electrons but iron 
. Table 2.7 Properties of an electrical circuit 
Conductors and resistivity 
Before we study Ohm’s law in detail, we need to look at conductors and insulators, and how much resistance a circuit has based on the material used as the conductor. This is based on the resistivity ( . ) of the material. 

has 26. The number of electrons in an atom equals the number of protons. 
When 6.24 × 1018 electrons flow in one direction, this is one coulomb of charge.

As different materials have different numbers of electrons, they conduct electricity differently. Each material has a resistivity value based on the measurement of the resistance of a 1 m3 block of the material at 20°C. Table 2.8 shows some common resistivity values. 

Material  Resistivity value (.)  
Common materials used as conductors  Copper  0.0172 × 10-6 .-m  
Aluminium  0.028 × 10-6 .-m

Common materials used as insulators  Hard rubber  1 × 1013 .-m  
Glass (average value)  1 × 1012 .-m  
Dry wood  1 × 1014 .-m  
PVC (average)  1 × 1015 .-m  

To work out the value of resistance, we use the material’s length (L) and cross-sectional area (CSA) (A) and apply the resistivity calculation: 
˜L
R A 
Remember, when you see a formula with no sign between two values, multiply them. So .L is actually . × L. 
When calculating resistivity, if you always use a resistivity value in µ.-m (micro-ohm-metres or × 10-6) and the CSA in mm2 (× 10-6), then the two values of × 10-6 cancel out. You can simply input the values without using the × 10-6.

Ohm’s law 
Ohm’s law explains the relationship between current, voltage and resistance in any electric circuit. It is applied to work out the quantities of a DC circuit and can be expressed as: 
VIR

To remember Ohm’s law, use the triangle in Figure 2.13 and cover the value you wish to find. It will leave the two other values and tell you whether they need to be divided or multiplied.

. Figure 2.15 Circuit with three resistors in series 
The circuit shown in Figure 2.16 has a supply voltage of 200 V and three resistors of 10 ., 15 . and 25 . in series. Let us calculate the circuit current. 

In a series circuit, the current remains the same through each resistor, but the voltage across each resistor is different. The voltage across each resistor can be calculated by applying Ohm’s law to that resistor. The value of all the voltages must equal the total circuit voltage. 
To calculate the voltage across each resistor in Figure 2.16:

As the current is based on the total circuit resistance, this needs to be determined first: 
Rt 102+ 51+ 550. 
Now Ohm’s law can be applied to determine the circuit current:

the supply voltage remains constant across all resistors, but the current in each branch changes.

The total resistance for the circuit is calculated by:

total 123 
A golden rule is that the total resistance must be less than the lowest resistor in the circuit. 
When calculating parallel resistances, do not forget that the total is divided into 1 at the end. 
Let us calculate the total resistance and each value of current, if the circuit in Figure 2.18 has the following values: • R1 = 20 . • R2 = 30 . • R3 = 40 . 
• V = 400 V.

Power in parallel and series circuits 
Let us look at a circuit with series and parallel resistors, then calculate the power. 

. Figure 2.20 Circuit with series and parallel resistors 
Looking at the circuit in Figure 2.20: 
• 
The current in the 5 . resistor is the same as the supply current (Is). 

• 
The current through each 10 . resistor is calculated in the same way as for a parallel circuit and must total the supply current. 

• 
The voltage V2 is the same across each 10 . resistor and V1 + V2 must equal the supply voltage. 

So, we can calculate: 

• 
total resistance of the parallel section (RP) 

• 
total circuit resistance 

• 
circuit current Is • voltages V1 and V2 • currents I1 and I2.

As the other 10 . resistor is the same, a total of 2000 W is dissipated in the parallel part of the circuit. 

5.6 Measurement of electrical circuits 

Instruments used to measure electrical quantities are listed in Table 2.9 and are connected as shown in Figure 2.23. 
. 
Table 2.9 Measurement of electrical circuits 

. 
Figure 2.23 How instruments are connected to measure circuit quantities 



Quantity to be measured  Instrument used  Connection  Notes  
Voltage  Voltmeter  In parallel to the item being measured  A voltmeter measures voltage difference from one side of a load to the other. This is called potential difference.  
Current  Ammeter  In series with the load  Ammeters can measure small currents this way, but for much larger currents a current transformer is needed (see section 5.4).  
Resistance  Ohmmeter  In parallel to the item being measured  An ohmmeter only works if the circuit or item being measured is disconnected from any power source.  
Power  Wattmeter  In both parallel and series  A wattmeter measures the voltage and current and then calculates the resulting power.  



5.7 Circuit protective devices 
There are four main groups of protective devices. 
Fuses 
Fuses have a wire element which heats up with current. 
If the current steadily reaches high values due to overloads, the wire melts over a period of time and the circuit disconnects. 
If the current suddenly reaches high values due to a fault, the wire melts very quickly and the circuit disconnects. 
Circuit breakers 
Circuit breakers have a magnetic coil. When a fault current reaches a pre-set value, the magnetic field causes mechanical movement and rapidly trips a switch, disconnecting the circuit. 
They also have a thermal trip (normally a bimetallic strip), which causes gradual mechanical movement when heated by lower overload currents. This also causes the switch to trip, disconnecting the circuit. 
Residual current devices (RCDs) 
RCDs have either electronic devices or a small toroidal transformer. They monitor the current entering a circuit through the live wire and the current returning through the neutral wire. 
If the circuit is healthy, the two currents remain identical. If a small fault happens, current flows to earth; the live wire has more current than the neutral wire. 
If the imbalance in current exceeds the device’s residual current setting, it trips instantly. The most common residual current setting for an RCD is 30 mA or 0.03 A, so these devices are highly sensitive. 
Residual circuit breaker with overload (RCBO) 
These are a miniature circuit breaker and RCD in the same body. They have the characteristics of both types of device. 

. Table 2.10 Forces 

Devices also have two different ratings: 
• 
Nominal rating (In) is the current value that the device can tolerate in continued service. For example, a 32 A circuit breaker can carry a 32 A load current for the lifetime specified by the manufacturer, without breaking or deteriorating. 

• 
Activation current (Ia) is the amount of current needed to disconnect the device in the time required by the type of circuit. For example, a socket-outlet circuit must disconnect within 0.4 seconds. 



Buildings need to stand up to a lot of stresses and forces. Approved Document A of the Building Regulations 2010 requires a building to be constructed in such a way as to withstand the combined dead, imposed and wind loads without deformation or movement that will affect stability. Therefore, the effects of forces need to be considered. 
6.1Forces acting on a building 
Five types of force can act on a building or part of a building. These force are described in Table 2.10 and shown in Figure 2.24. 
Force  Description  Example  How to resist it  
Tension  Force that tries to stretch a building or its components in opposite directions  The tension on vertical cables used in a suspension bridge, which hang the deck from the main cables  Use steel, which has good tensile strength, especially when wound into cables  
Compression  Force that tries to crush a component by pushing on both ends  A column in a building with the weight of the building resting on it and the force acting on the ground below  Use materials such as concrete, stone or masonry, which act well under compression  
Bending  Force that acts on the centre of a beam that is supported at each end  Beams that provide horizontal support, such as wooden floor joists, or support steels like rolled-steel joists (RSJs)  Use reinforced concrete for long spans, or steel or wooden joists for shorter lengths  
Torsion  Force that tries to twist the component in opposite directions  An entire building when subjected to strong wind  Use a closed hollow section, such as a steel box section, or circular structural elements such as poles  
Force  Description  Example  How to resist it  
Shear  Force that tries to split or divide a component Shearing forces work in opposite directions but do not have the same line of action, although they can be close  Wind in different directions at the top and bottom of a building  Use brick or concrete walls Shearing can occur in cement joints, so steel bracing helps  


Tension Compression Shear 

Torsion Bending 
. Figure 2.24 Forces acting on buildings and components 
There are other terms used to describe forces which act on a building: 
• 
Vertical forces act upwards or downwards on a building and result in tension or compression. 

• 
Horizontal forces act on the sides of a building and result in shear or torsion. They may be: 


– 
lateral – acting across the width of the building 

– 
longitudinal – acting along the length of the building. 



6.2Structural members 
The supporting parts of a building are known as structural members. 
Trusses Floor boards 





Lintel Window 

. Figure 2.25 Structural members used in a building 
In Figure 2.25, you can see the following parts: 
• 
Foundation: this is the lowest part of the substructure, supporting the building from sinking into the ground. Metal or concrete piles may be required where a foundation is unable to meet a solid base; these are drilled or driven deep into the ground to make sure the building is on a firm substructure. 

• 
Substructure: this is the complete section of a building extending below ground floor level. 

• 
Footings: these are the sections of masonry from the foundation to ground-floor level. They are normally linked to a particular member, such as a wall, not to the entire structure. 

• 
Columns: these are upright supports and can be steel or concrete. When columns are made from brick, they are often referred to as pillars. 

• 
Beams or girders: these are horizontal elements that form the support for floors. In a house, beams are used as main structural supports for first-floor walls that do not have a wall on the ground floor to support them. 

• 
Joists: these are similar to beams but are often wooden and many in number. They are used to support a flooring system above them and a ceiling below them. They are supported either by walls or by beams. 


• 
Trusses: these are normally associated with roofing systems and form triangles to provide support along large spans. Where trusses are used in walls, they are called braces. 

• 
Lintels: these are used to provide structural support above windows and doors. 


For a structure to remain sturdy and withstand all expected forces, it is important that the thickness and strength of all members are carefully calculated by structural engineers. 
6.3Drilling, notching and chasing 
Where services such as electrical wires, pipes and ducts are installed in buildings, they need to be run through some structural parts. 
Building regulations stipulate where notches or holes can be cut into a joist or beam so as not to weaken it, as shown in Figure 2.26. 
Notches on top and in a zone between 0.07 and 0.25 × overall span 

Holes on centre line and in a zone between 0.25 and 0.4 × overall span 
. Figure 2.26 Notching and cutting holes in a joist or beam 
Other things to note when cutting joists include: 
• 
The maximum diameter of holes should be 0.25 × joist depth. 

• 
Holes in the same joist must be at least three hole diameters apart. 

• 
The maximum depth of notch should be 0.125 × joist depth. 




If a wall is 400 mm thick, chases should be no deeper than: 
400
Vertical 133 mm 
3 
400
Horizontal 66.6 mm 
6 


6.4 Other effects on structures 
There are many other factors that can affect a structure and increase the risk of weakening its stability. 
Other buildings 
Neighbouring buildings can have several effects on each other, such as creating increased wind speeds. Currents of air moving around structures travel at different speeds, and these forces can have damaging effects on buildings. 
Foundations from other buildings also have an impact, as the force of the building’s weight is transferred into the ground at 45-degree angles. This could cause soil movement beneath or close to adjacent buildings. 
Drains and sewers 
These underground systems can collapse if buildings are built on top of them, causing buildings to lean as one section of the foundation drops. 
Proximity to drains and sewers also influences the depth of a foundation. Building weight is transferred to the ground from the foundation at a 45-degree angle from the footprint. As a result, there is potential for damage to drains and sewers if they are located within that 45-degree area. This means that the foundation is typically excavated to a depth that is at least the same as the deepest part of the drain or sewer. 
Trees 
The roots of trees, especially fast-growing trees, can damage building foundations. As trees absorb moisture from the ground, this can cause uneven drying of soils under foundations or footings. Shrinkage of soils can cause foundations to collapse or crack. 
Different soil structures 
Soils shrink and expand depending on rainfall and levels of the water table. Soils which are permeable (allow water to drain through) are more stable than non-permeable soils, such as clay. 
Soils can also shift or move. If this happens under part of a building, it can cause subsidence, meaning one side of the building drops or moves away from other parts. The initial signs of subsidence are cracks forming in walls. 


There is much more to heating a building than just considering the source of the heat. Buildings need to be kept warm in winter and cool in summer. Equally, temperature control and air changes are important to prevent condensation, which can lead to damp and mould growth. 

7.1Heat transfer 
There are three methods of transferring heat: 
• 
convection 

• 
conduction 

• 
radiation. 




Convection 
Convection occurs when air or water is heated and then moves away from the source of the heat, carrying thermal energy. 
For example, a wall-mounted convection heater or radiator heats the air around it, causing the hot air to rise. This is moved into the room by cooler air entering the bottom of the heater or radiator, creating convection currents which rotate around a room. 
The term ‘radiator’ is a misnomer, as most of the heat output is via convection. They are not called convectors, however, because a true convector has a heat source that is not exposed. 



Warm air rises 
Air falls as it cools 
Heating element heating air 



Cold air drawn in as warm air rises 



. Figure 2.27 The convection cycle 
Convection also occurs when an immersion heater conducts heat to the water close to the element. This causes hot water to rise in the vessel, allowing the element to heat cooler water that replaces the hot, rising water. 
Convection heaters: 
• 
are a good way to heat most sizes of room 

• 
can be wall mounted 

• 
can use elements or pipes buried in the floor to heat a large space 

• 
are less effective in small spaces with limited air circulation. 


Conduction 
Conduction is when heat is transferred directly into a material, for example brick in the case of a storage heater. When a substance is heated, the molecules gain more energy and vibrate more. They then bump into other nearby molecules and transfer some of their energy to them. Conduction is therefore not appropriate for heating air directly, as the molecules are too far apart. 

The following are examples of heating systems using conduction: 
• 
Floor-heating systems conduct heat to the floor, which causes air convection above it. 

• 
Hot-water immersion systems directly heat water around the element. 

• 
Instantaneous water heaters have an element that is wound around a metal water pipe. Heat is conducted through the pipe into the water. As the amount of water in the pipe is small, it heats up quickly. 


Radiation 
Radiant heaters: 
• 
use infrared radiation to heat bodies, but not the air around them 

• 
are directional – there must be a line of sight in order to heat a person 

• 
are particularly useful in large areas where heating the air is not required or efficient, for example outdoor patio heaters 

• 
require a large amount of power and are therefore less efficient than convection heaters. 




7.2Characteristics of air 
Modern buildings strive to be more energy efficient by keeping heat in, but this can also cause problems if a building does not allow air changes to occur. Air will become stale and contaminated, causing breathing problems. 
In addition, if a building is allowed to heat up but moist warm air comes into contact with colder surfaces, such as windows, condensation forms, which in turn can cause mildew or rot. Air contains water vapour, and the amount of water vapour in the air is known as the level of humidity. Warmer air can hold more water vapour, but if that air touches cooler surfaces, or the air is rapidly cooled by mechanical means such as an air-conditioning system, the humid air vapour will condense into liquid water. 

. Figure 2.29 Mould in the corner of a window 
Getting the balance right is difficult, so if a building does not have a forced air change by fans, it needs to occur naturally. This can happen by pressure differences, which can be caused by wind or the convection effect created by differences in temperature or humidity. In either case, the amount of ventilation depends on the size and positioning of openings in the building. 
Buildings with a staircase or an open chimney will create air changes by the stack effect, where warm, less-dense air rises, drawing cooler dense air into the base of a building through any opening. As air warms, it expands and becomes less dense, as there is less air occupying a space, but as it cools it contracts, meaning more air occupies a space, so it becomes denser. 
Ideally, a normal room in a house should have a minimum of four air changes per hour. A minimum of six changes per hour should occur in bathrooms and toilets, but these are likely to have forced air systems such as extraction fans creating more changes. 
. Figure 2.28 A radiant heater 

In public places, this increases to a minimum of ten changes per hour in normal occupied rooms, and 12 in places such as restaurants. 
7.3 Heat loss in buildings 
Buildings lose heat through the different construction materials used. Even if walls are well insulated, doors and windows can cause heat loss. 
All materials used in construction have ratings of thermal conductivity, known as K-values. These are values given by manufacturers of the materials. 
Table 2.11 gives examples of commonly used materials and their average thermal conductivity (K) value in watts per metre Kelvin (W/m K). 
. Table 2.11 Thermal conductivity of common materials 

Material  Average K value (W/m K)  
Light blockwork  0.38

R-values 
Once a K-value is known for a material, the amount of heat resistance the material offers can be calculated. This is known as the R-value. 
The R-value can be calculated based on the thickness of the material: 
thickness of material (m)R value K value (W/ mK) 
Using Table 2.11, the R-value for 12.5 mm (0.0125 m) thick plasterboard can be determined as: 
0.0125
R 0.05 W /m2.K
0.25 

Note the units for R-value: watts per metre squared Kelvin or W/m2.K. 

U-values 
A U-value is the rate of heat transfer for a wall, ceiling or floor. 

To calculate the total heat loss for a wall, determine the U-value based on the materials used. 
For example, consider a wall constructed using the following materials: 
• 
a 50 mm air cavity (Ra) 

In addition to building materials in the wall, external air resistance and internal air resistance need to be taken into account. These have predetermined R-values of: 

• 
internal air resistance (Rsi) 0.13 W/mK 

• 
external air resistance (Rse) 0.04 W/mK. 


• 
100 mm exposed brick (R3). 

So, to calculate the U-value of the wall:

So, for our wall: 
U 1 1.136 W /m2.K
0.13 + 0.05 + 0.26 + 0.28 + 0.12 + 0.04 

Some manufacturers provide U-values for their products, such as doors and windows. As an example, these could be: 
• 
3 W/m2.K for a double-glazed window that has 12 mm spacing between the panes of glass 

• 
2.5 W/m2.K for an external door which has a standard fire rating. 


Using U-values, we can calculate the heat loss in watts through various parts of a building: 
area of surface × temperature difference ×                  U-value for surface 
The temperature difference relates to the desired room temperature and the average lowest outdoor temperature. So, if a room needs to be heated to 20°C, and the outdoor temperature has an average low of -3°C, the difference is 23°C. Once each surface heat loss has been determined, including the heat loss through air changes, these are added to calculate the overall heat loss. 

. Figure 2.30 A room with heat loss 
Figure 2.30 shows a room with dimensions. Assuming the height of the room is 2.6 m, we can calculate the overall heat loss if the desired temperature is 20°C and the outside average low is 2°C. Let us assume all the R-values have been calculated so that the following U-values are given, and we will assume the room undergoes two air changes per hour: • Walls: 0.35 • Floor: 0.25 • Ceiling: 0.25 • Windows: 2.9 • Door: 2.9 
• Air change: 0.33. 
Room volume:

So, loss is: 
39.85 ×(20 - 2)× 0.35 251.1 W 

Floor and ceiling heat loss (as both have the same dimension and U-value): 
6 × 2.5 ×(20 - 2)× 0.25 67.5 W × 2 135 W 

Air-change loss needs to consider the volume of the room, the number of air changes and the U-value for the air loss, which is 0.33: 
39 ×(20 2)2 0.33 463.3 W 
- ×× 

So, the total heat loss is: 
133 + 93.6 + 251.1+ 135 + 463.3 1076 W or 1.076 kW 

Therefore, the room would require some form of heating system to counter this loss and maintain the required temperature. 
7.4 Methods of heating a building 
Several types of building services system can be used to provide heat, for example: 
• 
electric wall-mounted convection heaters (including storage heaters) 

• 
electric floor-heating elements 

• 
wet floor-heating systems 

• 
wet heat-emitting radiators 

• 
ground or air source heat pumps. 


Electric convection heaters, known as panel heaters, contain electric heating elements. Cool air is drawn into the bottom of the unit, passes over the heating element and rises out of the unit as warmed air. 
Electric storage heaters contain bricks that sandwich heating elements. The elements heat the bricks, which then store the heat and gently release it into the room using the convection cycle. The advantage of storage heaters is they can consume electricity at times when costs are lower, such as night time, then release the heat at other times. 
Wet heating systems have boilers that heat water and pump it around the building to radiators or floor-heating pipework. The fuel used for the boiler can be: 
• 
gas • oil 

• 
biomass. 


Gas can be delivered by mains pipes into the building, and this is metered at supply. Alternatively, tanks can be used to store gas delivered to the property. 
Oil is also delivered to a property and stored in tanks for future use. 

. Table 2.12 Main lighting terms 

Biomass heating systems use specially made wood pellets, which are burned to produce the heat source for the pumped water system. They are said to be carbon neutral, or low carbon, as the carbon dioxide (CO2) released by burning the wood is equal to the CO2 released by the wood if it were left to decay naturally. We will explore this, ground/air source heat pumps and other technologies used to heat or cool a building, in Chapter 5. 

Lighting design has become a very specialist area because of the vast range of lighting and luminaires available. Light-emitting diode (LED) technology is used as the main form of lighting, due to its energy­efficient performance and light quality. 

8.1Main lighting terms 
Table 2.12 considers the main lighting terms. 
Term  Definition  
Luminous intensity  This is the amount of light emitted per solid angle or in a given direction. It is denoted by the symbol l and measured in candela (cd).  
Luminous flux  This is the total amount of light emitted from a source. It is denoted by the symbol F and measured in lumens (lm).  
Illuminance  This is the amount of light falling on a surface. It is denoted by the symbol E and measured in lumens per metre2 (lux).  
Efficacy  This is the efficiency of a lamp or luminaire and compares the amount of light emitted to the electrical power consumed. It is denoted by the symbol K and measured in lumens per watt (lm/W).  
Maintenance factor (mf) Light loss factor (llf)  These are factors used to derate the light output of a lamp, allowing for dust. The factor used depends on the environment. An average office environment would have a factor of 0.8, whereas a factory where lots of dust accumulates may have a factor of 0.4.  
Coefficient of utilisation or utilisation factor (uf)  This is a measure of the efficiency of a lamp in transferring light energy to a surface, such as a wall or ceiling. Emitted light bounces off reflective walls, making more effective use of the light. An average factor for a room is 0.6. The lighter the colour of the room, the higher the factor.  
Glare  Glare is a very bright light that is difficult to look at. Poor positioning of luminaires can cause glare, resulting in people squinting, getting headaches or experiencing general discomfort.  
Term  Definition  
Diffuser/louvre  Diffusers are normally translucent plastic or glass covers that refract harsh light, dispersing it to create an even light from a single source. A louvre is polished metal which reflects light in different directions, dispersing a harsh glare into softer dispersed light.  
Colour rendering  This is the appearance of light in terms of colour. Lamps produce either orange light or blue light, depending on the gases used in them. This in turn can make objects under the lights look different in colour. For example, sodium lamps were once commonly used for street lighting, but this gives the appearance that everything lit by them is orange. This was never considered much of a problem, as hazards could still be seen and avoided. In more modern times, whiter colours are preferred as they are better for CCTV images and also make people feel safer.  


. Table 2.13 Types of lamp 

8.2Choosing the right type of lamp 
Artificial lighting consumes a lot of energy. Even during daylight hours, many offices, shops and public buildings have lights switched on. It is therefore important to choose lamps that: 
• 
provide a good-quality light with the correct colour rendering 

• 
consume power efficiently. 


Table 2.13 shows the different types of lamp available, their basic operating principles and their characteristics including efficacy (an indication of power to light performance). 
Lamp type  Basic operating principles  Characteristics and applications  
General lighting service (GLS)  A filament is suspended in a vacuum. When current flows through the filament, it glows white hot, producing light.  GLS lamps rated above 100 W were banned due to their poor efficacy (approximately 14 lumens/watt). Caps are usually bayonet (BC) or Edison screw (ES).  
Tungsten halogen  A filament is suspended in halogen gas, which prevents evaporation. This allows the lamp to run at much higher temperatures than standard GLS lamps, meaning a brighter light.  These were widely available in ratings up to 500 W but have been superseded by LED lighting. Smaller G4 or G9 lamps are still common in table or display lamps. Halogen lamps have an average efficacy of 17 lumens/watt.  
High-pressure sodium (SON)  Current strikes across low-temperature sodium gas in a tube, causing it to heat up and ionise, producing light. The lamps are known as discharge lamps.  These were widely used for car park or street lighting, as they are suited to the illumination of large areas. The colour output is slightly orange. Average efficacy is 120 lumens/watt.  
Low-pressure sodium (SOX)  These work on a similar principle to high­pressure sodium lamps but they have larger gas-filled tubes, with lower sodium gas pressures, and are usually U shaped.  These were widely used for street lighting due to their very high efficacy but colour rendering is poor, with a dull orange light output. Average efficacy is 180 lumens/watt. Although still around today, they are rarely used in new lighting schemes.  
High-pressure mercury (MBFU)  These work on a similar principle to high­pressure sodium lamps, but have tubes filled with mercury gas.  These are commonly used for utility/communal lighting because of their better colour rendering, which is white with a slight blue tinge. Efficacy values are on average 80 lumens/watt.  

. Table 2.13 Types of lamp 

Lamp type  Basic operating principles  Characteristics and applications  
Metal halide (HID)  These discharge lamps are similar in operation to high-pressure sodium lamps but they use a mixture of mercury and sodium gases.  These produce a bright white light but efficacy is lower as a result and averages 60 lumens/watt.  
Low-pressure mercury (fluorescent)  Commonly known as fluorescent tubes, these mercury-filled tubes have an inner coating of phosphor powder, making a blue ultraviolet light inside the tube and various types of white light on the outside.  These are still widely available but are slowly being replaced by LED tubes. Efficacy is on average 100 lumens/watt.  
Compact fluorescent (CFL)  These are small versions of fluorescent tubes, where the tube is often bent to occupy smaller areas.  Designed to replace the GLS lamps banned by EU directives, these often have ES or BC caps. Efficacy is on average 65 lumens/watt.  
LED  Made up of several light emitting diodes (LEDs), these lamps require control gear, known as drivers, to reduce and rectify voltage and govern current.  LED lamps and luminaires are now widely used for all applications, from general room lighting to street lighting and stadium illumination. Efficacy is on average 120 lumens/watt but this is improving all the time.  

LED lighting is becoming the most common form of lighting due to: 
• 
good efficacy 

• 
the ability to change colour rendering to suit a location, for example warm white, daylight or coloured 

• 
longer-lasting lamps. 



9.1Acoustics in buildings 
Acoustics is a term used to describe the study of mechanical waves that travel through gases, solids and liquids causing vibration and sound. This could be from somebody speaking, a loudspeaker playing music or someone banging on something like a drum. 
. Table 2.14 Terms used in the study of acoustics 


Different materials and the shape of those materials affect the way sound waves move. In most construction applications, the desire is to provide acoustic comfort rather than to enhance acoustics, such as in a concert hall. Poor acoustic protection can lead to severe health conditions, such as hearing loss, high blood pressure, headaches and sleep deprivation. 
9.2 Factors that affect acoustics 
Before we consider methods of providing acoustic comfort, we need to understand some terms used in the study of acoustics. 
Term  Description  
Reverberation  Reverberation is the persistence of a sound following its creation. It is caused when sound reflects off surfaces and decays. Even when the initial source of the sound stops, the reflections can continue, with their amplitude decreasing until zero is reached.  
Reverberation time  Reverberation time is a measurement, in seconds, of the time it takes for a sound to decay and stop entirely. For small rooms, it should typically be under a second, and no more than two seconds for larger rooms.  
Frequency  Frequency is the number of waves that occur in a period of time. For sound waves, this determines the pitch of a sound. Low-frequency sounds (fewer waves per second) are lower in pitch than high-frequency sounds.  
Resonance  Materials have different natural resonant frequencies. This is simply the frequency of sound and pressure which causes the material to move easily and vibrate. For example, if a loudspeaker is placed in front of a glass and the frequency of the sound is increased (low pitch to high pitch), there will be a point where the glass shatters because it vibrates to the point of destruction.  
Term  Description  
Sound absorption  Sound absorption is where sound waves are suppressed or absorbed by an item or structure, rather than being reflected.  
Sound transmission class (STC) rating  An STC rating is a numerical value showing how well a structure reduces sound transmission. It is commonly used to rate doors, walls, windows, ceilings and floors. The higher the value, the better the structure is at reducing sound travel. A well soundproofed wall typically has an STC rating above 50.  
Sound barrier  A sound barrier is a material that can be placed on a structure (such as a wall, ceiling or floor) to increase its STC rating.  
Attenuation  Attenuation is the gradual loss of intensity. It refers to a structure’s ability to limit sound transmission.  
Baffle  Acoustic baffles are devices which reduce the strength of airborne sound. They absorb sound, reducing echo and lowering reverberation time. When baffles are designed to be suspended from a ceiling, they are referred to as clouds.  
Decibel  The decibel is the unit of measurement for sound.  
Flanking sound  Flanking sound is sound that travels between two areas, such as through air vents and ducts to reach another room.  
Footfall  Footfall is the sound made by walking on a surface.  

9.3Principles of sound 
If you have ever been in a large open space with bare, hard walls, you will have experienced a very echoey environment. Soft materials, such as fabrics and foams, create a sound-absorbent surface where sound does not reverberate. 
The following can help to absorb sound waves and prevent reverberation: 
• 
cavity wall insulation, such as rock wool or fibre wool 

• 
isolation membrane (a thin barrier in walls, ceiling voids and doors) 

• 
flooring materials, such as carpets or wood 

• 
soundproof foam panels (usually shaped into small pyramids). 


When considering the installation of building systems, their location will have a bearing on the noise they produce. If a system component, such as a gas boiler or circulation pump, vibrates in operation, this will create sound. Any materials in contact with the component can also vibrate, which in turn can amplify this sound. In some cases, acoustic hangers or fixings may be required to reduce the transfer of vibrations. 
If equipment is located outdoors, such as air source heat pumps, the sound from the fans can cause sound pollution. 



9.4 Laws and regulations on noise restriction 
Laws restrict noise levels between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., and councils must investigate any complaints of noise above permitted levels. As a guide, constant underlying noise levels of 24 decibels (dBA) are permitted, with increases to 34 dBA intermittently. 
Approved Document E of the Building Regulations covers resistance to sound and sets out standards for new homes and conversions. While the statutory requirements are barely one page long, the guidance for complying with the requirements is very detailed, including information on: 
.
 soundproofing, including the transmission of sound between walls, ceilings, windows and floors 

.
 prevention of unwanted sound travel within different areas of a building, including flats and connecting buildings 

.
 the structure of materials and formation of elements of the building, including building services, especially where these services penetrate walls, floors and ceilings 

.
 the need to lag pipework or soundproof socket outlets recessed into a partition wall.

10 Earth science principles 
Earth science is a wide-ranging subject, covering ground structures, watercourses, water cycles and earth forces such as earthquakes. For buildings to remain safe and stable for their lifespan, they rely on the ground being stable below them. 
In this section, we will look at basic ground structures, watercourses and the water cycle, and how earth forces can be detrimental to buildings and structures in the UK. 
10.1 Ground structure 
We usually consider changing soil conditionsin the context of the ground being muddy, hard or good for growing things. However, this only relates to the first layer of topsoil we encounter in our daily lives. When constructing buildings, we need to consider the soil structure deeper below the topsoil; and in the case of high-rise buildings, we must go deeper still. Figure 2.33 shows the different layers of soil. Although the illustrations show the layers in a relatively small depth, in reality the bedrock layer can be very deep. 
Key term 
Bedrock: solid rock usually found beneath the 
weaker surface materials of the ground 
Topsoil Subsoil Groundwater 
Bedrock 

. Figure 2.33 Layers of soil 
Low-rise buildings with shallow foundations typically have footings or foundations at least 1 m deep in clay­type subsoils, as these soils are prone to shrinkage or freezing due to their water content up to 0.75 m in depth. Stony subsoils, where water is less likely to be held, may allow for shallower foundations, but this depends on the water table. 

Where buildings require more stability, such as high-rise buildings, foundations need to be in contact with the bedrock layer. This is normally achieved using piles. Figure 2.34 shows piles being drilled into the ground, where reinforced concrete is then poured to give a solid connection to the bedrock. 

. Figure 2.34 Piles being drilled, with reinforcement being dropped into the pile hole ready for concrete to be poured 
In addition, soil cleanliness is important. On all proposed development sites, soil samples must be taken and analysed before any building works begin, to ensure the ground has not been contaminated by previous activities. Many years ago, some locations had uses that were never documented or recorded, such as landfill-type waste tips. In these situations, the decomposing waste could have caused pockets of methane gas to build up in the ground, creating a long­term explosion risk. Other sources of contamination include chemical seepage from old factory sites. 

10.2Watercourses 
A watercourse is a channel through which water flows. Examples include a wide river, a small stream, a ditch which is dry for most parts of the year, or an underground river. 
Watercourses are important as they drain the land. Without them, water would cause soils to become unstable, leading to subsidence or even landslips. It is therefore important that watercourses of any type are kept free of obstruction and not overloaded. 
When new developments are built, surface water needs to be drained into local watercourses, which can create flood risks if not managed correctly. Surface-water flooding is now the biggest cause of property flooding. Water that falls as rain on fields takes time to filter through the soils into the natural drain. When water falls on hard surfaces, such as roads, pavements and roofs, this water drains into the watercourses much more quickly, causing flash floods. With more developments comes more risk of flash floods. 

Measures used to manage surface water, known as attenuation, include: 
• 
underground flood tanks that store water and gradually release it into local watercourses 

• 
the creation of ponds or reedbeds to store or absorb surface water or gradually release it into local watercourses such as streams, brooks or rivers 

• 
soakaways, which disperse surface water into the ground where it slowly drains into watercourses. 


When considering flood risks, it is worth looking at the water cycle and the way land drains after rainfall. Figure 2.35 shows how rainfall seeps through permeable soils and forms the water table. Water seeps through soils to either aquifers, which are like underground rivers or lakes, or into above-ground rivers or lakes. These eventually drain to the sea, where evaporation starts the water cycle by forming rain clouds. 

. Figure 2.35 How rainfall naturally drains 
10.3 Earth forces 
The Earth’s crust is made up of large, moving pieces known as tectonic plates. At a boundary, plates can move apart, move together or slide past each other. The joins at plate boundaries are known as fault lines, and these are danger zones for earthquakes. On occasion, the moving plates become jammed so tension and forces build. Eventually the forces become too great and the sudden release results in an earthquake, shaking the ground violently. The UK is not close to any fault lines, so the risk of earthquakes is low. That does not mean, however, that they do not happen, as some minor tremors have affected the UK. 

Other earth forces that are closer to home are those caused by weather and tides. 
While wind can cause serious damage to buildings and structures during storms, persistent wind and rain can also cause slow but damaging erosion to some materials. One example is limestone, which dissolves when it comes into contact with carbonic acid, common in rainwater. Mortar used for pointing between bricks is also prone to weathering, especially in areas such as chimneys. Where building services equipment is located in exposed outdoor areas, it can also become damaged through weathering. 
Flooding through storm water is becoming a more frequent occurrence due to global warming. Storm water is not just a huge amount of rainwater released into drains, as discussed above with watercourses. High tidal conditions, caused by spring tides and storm surges, also restrict river drainage, because high levels of seawater act as a barrier to the draining river water. 
Climate change is increasing the likelihood of heavy rain in the UK, particularly during the winter months, leading to higher risks of flooding and less stable soils.

1.1 Factors of good design 
Design function 
Before choosing a method of construction, it is important to understand how the building will achieve its design function. All buildings are initially designed to meet the client’s specification because without them to finance the work, there is no project. However, sometimes the needs of the client have to be compromised to satisfy local restrictions, planning laws, building regulations and environmental requirements. In addition, designers have to consider: 
• 
the aesthetics of the building and how it will fit into its proposed environment 

• 
access and egress 

• 
security 

• 
internal layout and arrangement of rooms/spaces 

• 
energy efficiency. 


Once these aspects have been determined, designers and clients must decide what form of construction to use for the superstructure of the building. There are several important factors to consider when selecting a method of construction, for example, build speed, familiarity with the building system and cost. 


By contrast, the substructure of a building is the part below ground level. For more information on superstructure and substructure, see Chapter 7. 
Environmental impact 
The way we construct and use buildings for all types of purpose will have an impact on the environment. However, with considerate planning and the use of modern and innovative building materials, this impact can be minimised. 
Without tight monitoring systems and control measures, construction work on greenfield sites and other types of land such as conservation areas may result in damage or destruction of natural wildlife habitats. (There is further information on greenfield and brownfield sites in section 1.3 of this chapter.) 
Inconsiderate construction and inappropriate disposal of waste materials can lead to pollution of the land, the air and natural water courses, such as streams, rivers and lakes. This can damage or destroy whole ecosystems, outside the boundary of the site and beyond the lifetime of the development. 


. Figure 3.3 A brownfield site 
The environmental impact of a building’s design, construction and use is controlled and monitored by: 
• 
an environmental impact assessment (EIA) 

• 
an energy performance certificate (EPC) 

• 
the Code for Sustainable Homes 

• 
a site waste management plan (SWMP) 

• 
building regulations (Part L). 




Environmental impact assessment (EIA) 
The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 require developers to identify significant effects on the environment of their proposed construction project at the planning application stage. If the type of development is listed in Schedule 2 of the regulations and exceeds the thresholds set out there, the local authority must screen the proposals to determine the likely environmental impact and decide whether an EIA is required. This also allows the public an early opportunity to be involved with decision-making procedures. 
The regulations affect only a small proportion of private and public projects that require planning permission; however, they could also apply to some permitted development. 




Energy performance certificate (EPC) 
EPCs are a legal requirement for domestic and commercial properties in the UK that are available to buy or rent. However, some buildings may be exempt, for example, residential buildings that are intended to be used for less than four months a year and listed buildings. 
To obtain an EPC, an accredited assessor must evaluate the energy efficiency of a building. They will check that loft and wall insulation has been correctly installed, and they will review records of energy use (also referred to as heat demand) for the past two years. Once satisfied, they will award an energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient) and a certificate containing information about the property’s energy use and average energy costs. The certificate may also make recommendations about how to reduce energy use and save money on energy bills in the future. 
EPC assessments are valid for ten years for domestic properties and are available to view on the Landmark Register in England and Wales, and the Scottish EPC Register in Scotland. 





Code for Sustainable Homes 
Launched in 2006, the Code for Sustainable Homes was a government-led environmental assessment method for rating and certifying the performance of new homes in the UK. It set national standards for the design and construction of new domestic properties, with the aim of improving sustainable building methods. 
The government withdrew the code in 2015 and consolidated some of the benchmarks into existing building regulations. Although adherence to the code is no longer a condition for new planning proposals, it still endures where outline planning permission was granted before March 2015 or where there are existing contractual arrangements. 


Site waste management plan (SWMP) 
A site waste management plan (SWMP) sets out how waste will be managed and disposed of during a construction project. 

The plan should be prepared by the client, along with the design team, contractor and subcontractor, and it should identify: 
• 
the different types of waste that will be created throughout the project 

• 
where the waste is expected to be found 

• 
the minimum estimated quantities of each type of waste 

• 
the actions that the client and principal contractor intend to take to minimise the amount of waste by reusing and recycling. 


For more information on waste management and SWMPs, see Chapter 5, section 8. 
. Figure 3.6 Construction site waste being recycled in skips 

Building regulations (Part L) 
Part L of the building regulations is concerned with the conservation of fuel and power in new buildings (Approved Document L1A) and existing buildings (Approved Document L1B). (There is further information on Approved Documents in section 2.1 of this chapter.) 
To help the government meet its targets to reduce carbon emissions, the regulations identify measurable rates to determine the energy efficiency of a building.

The calculated rate of CO2 emissions from a dwelling (the Dwelling CO2 Emission Rate, DER) must not exceed the Target CO2 Emission Rate (TER). 

• 
The Dwelling Fabric Energy Efficiency (DFEE) rate must not exceed the Target Fabric Energy Efficiency (TFEE) rate. 


The regulations also provide technical guidance on the quality of materials and standards of work to achieve the TER and TFEE rates in areas such as secondary heating and lighting. 

1.2 The benefits of good design and the potential implications of poor design 
A building that has been properly thought out and planned will benefit the end user in many ways. Prospective buyers often look for the following qualities in new homes. 
• 
Aesthetics – the building should have ‘kerb appeal’ (it should be attractive when viewed from the road) and have modern amenities. It should be in keeping with its surroundings and add value to the community. 

• 
Efficiency – the building should have a good energy efficiency rating, allowing it to be cost-effective to run. 

• 
Sustainability – the use of sustainable materials and alternative energy sources could make the property more desirable. 

• 
Wellbeing and improved quality of life – these can be achieved by maximising natural light and ensuring efficient ventilation within the building, as well as enabling access to outdoor living spaces such as gardens, terraces or balconies. 

• 
Affordable quality – ‘affordable’ is considered a median household income or lower, determined by the local or national government. Careful selection of building materials, methods and processes without unforeseen delays will bring in the construction project on budget. 

• 
Improved local/community facilities – this could include accessible parks, woodland, play areas, community outdoor gyms, sports clubs, leisure facilities and shops. 

• 
Improved infrastructure – this could include footpaths, roads, parking, bus routes and pedestrian bridges.

Impact on the local community 
A building must meet the needs of both the client financing the project (the ‘project sponsor’) and the local community, now and for future generations. A development that serves the purpose of the client but is not well designed or managed throughout the construction phase can cause disruption to the local community with noise, light and air pollution, not to mention increased construction traffic and on-street parking. 
A poorly planned development could have a negative impact on both the local economy and the way the area functions, for example, consider the effect it might have on local infrastructure. On average, most of the new occupants will drive some form of vehicle that will increase the amount of traffic in the area, particularly at peak times. This may result in delays, wear and tear on the roads, increased pollution and limited parking. The higher population will increase demand on local schools, healthcare facilities, shops and the job market. 


. Figure 3.8 Infrastructure of a community 
Building new houses creates short-term employment opportunities for the development team. However, when the building phase is completed, those houses will be sold and occupied by people with social and economic needs. 
To ease the shortage of affordable housing, it is often a condition of planning approval that a percentage of all newly built homes are allocated to meet this need. The National Planning Policy Framework states that at least ten per cent of most new developments should be affordable housing. 

Impact on parties in the construction chain 
A new housing development needs to enable a local community to function and grow, and to bring employment opportunities. A failure to meet these needs will be reflected in slow sales and reduced profitability. 

Large housing developments are usually divided into smaller phases by the building management team. Each phase is completed and sold in turn, to finance further phases of the overall development. If the development and buildings have not been well designed and constructed in the right area at the right time, then slow sales at an early stage in the development can have a major impact on a number of different parties in the construction chain: 
• 
The client may be unable to finance further phases or to make repayments to the project sponsor (for example, a bank, a shareholder or an investor). Broken repayment agreements could result in financial penalties for the client. A failed venture could damage the client’s reputation and impact on the financing of future developments. 

• 
The project sponsor may not finance any further building work or future developments. 

• 
Construction work might be paused, leading to a reduction in size of the project team until sales pick up and further phases of construction work are started. This could cause difficulties when building recommences in terms of re-employing contractors and subcontractors at the right time, leading to further delays. 

• 
Suppliers may not be paid on time by contractors and subcontractors, because they are no longer employed. This can lead to a loss of confidence and goodwill, making it difficult to find suppliers willing to provide further building materials or credit terms. Material costs could increase the longer the development is delayed. 


Impact of poor design and poor quality of work 
Poor design and poor quality of work can result in a building failing to perform as expected after transfer of ownership to the end user. This can result in further negative impacts on the customer and client, such as high energy bills and the fabric of the building degrading. 
Materials that have been inappropriately specified, selected, stored and used during construction work can often lead to failures at a later stage. Building materials can fail when exposed to certain conditions, as shown in Table 3.1. 
. Table 3.1 Common failures in building materials 

Building material  Failure  Cause  
Ferrous metal  Corrosion (an electrochemical process)  Exposure to moisture and other chemicals  
Timber  Decay/collapse (when the timber contains no chlorophyll)  Fungal attack (dry/wet rot) due to moisture content above 20 per cent Woodworm  
Warps, splits and shakes  Poor storage (unsupported/exposed to the elements/poor seasoning)  
Burning  Unprotected timber positioned too close to a heat source  
Brickwork and concrete  Deterioration and cracking of concrete or mortar joints Splitting of bricks and blocks  Frost attack as a result of water expanding as it freezes in porous materials Sulphate attack Incorrect ratios of materials used in the mixing of mortar and concrete  

 Efflorescence  Water containing salt in the materials migrating to the surface and drying  
Paint  Flaking/peeling  Ultraviolet light (sunlight) attacking the paint Inadequate paint preparation and poor choice of primers

Building material  Failure  Cause  
Plastic  Becoming brittle  Ultraviolet light (sunlight) attacking the plastic  
Expansion and contraction  Extreme temperatures (heat/cold)  

 Discolouration  Low-grade plastic  
Glass  Misting  Failure of seals between double-/ triple-glazed units, allowing the thermal gases to escape and moisture to enter between the layers of glass  


1.3 Factors that can impact on the profitability of projects 
At the planning stage of any development, a feasibility study is usually carried out by the client and the management team, to check that the project is both viable and potentially profitable. The study usually considers areas such as: 
• 
finances (profits/losses) 

• 
budgets 



• 
resources (labour, plant and equipment) 

• 
environmental impact 

• 
scheduling 

• 
appraisal of the proposed development site regarding existing services, waterways, boundaries and topography 

• 
investigations into the history of the land above and below ground, identifying any unforeseen features that have the potential to make building work more complicated and costly, such as old wells, tunnels and mines 

• 
historical architectural interest or any existing features, structures or buildings that could delay construction work or even prevent it from going ahead. 




. Figure 3.9 The topography of a piece of land 
Greenfield and brownfield sites 
Reusing a brownfield site for a new development makes environmental sense. However, from a financial point of view it is more costly, because existing buildings need to be removed and the ground needs to be prepared (for example, by clearing contaminated soil and waste). 
For ease of building purposes and to maximise profits, many developers would prefer to use a greenfield site. Building work can usually start quickly on these sites with less preparation, and contractors do not have to contend with any existing hazardous waste or unforeseen development issues. However, building on a greenfield site is controversial, as many people believe we have a moral responsibility to protect the environment. There may also be local planning restrictions in place to preserve greenfield sites and only allow new developments when certain criteria are met. 
Over-specification and difficulty of assembly 
Developments that are over-specified or over­engineered can result in lower profits, even before construction work has begun. Unique design ideas and complicated assembly of components often result in difficulties during manufacturing and construction, due to the workforce’s lack of familiarity, knowledge and skills. These complications can lead to increased timescales, missed deadlines and stretched budgets. 
Vernacular construction 
The design of the houses in a development may be sympathetic or particular to a region, relying on locally sourced materials and traditional skills that have developed over generations. This method of region­specific house building is referred to as vernacular construction. Traditionally, construction methods did not follow contemporary mainstream architectural designs, until the Victorian period when building materials and styles became increasingly standardised. 

Given the distinct regional characteristics of such buildings, it is problematic to design and specify this form of construction anywhere other than where it is usually found. It would be difficult to achieve the same standards of work without employing labour and sourcing materials from further away. 

. Figure 3.10 This stone house in the Cotswolds, built with local materials, is an example of vernacular construction 
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
Although construction businesses need to make a profit, this should not be at the expense of the world around them. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to strategies adopted by businesses to ensure they monitor and manage their social, economic and environmental impact on all aspects of society. 
The CSR business model is self-regulated and can take many different forms, depending on the type of industry. It supports companies in being socially accountable to themselves, their stakeholders and the general public, in order to have a positive influence on the world. Businesses using this model not only benefit society but also themselves, by boosting morale between employers and employees and improving the reputation of their corporate brand. 

Typical examples of CSR in construction include: development, which is not always feasible and may 
• 
providing services for the community 

• 
supporting charitable activities 

• 
using ethically and sustainably sourced building materials 

• 
reducing the environmental impact of construction work. 




2.1 Factors to be considered during the design of building services 
A client must consider many factors as part of their concept for a building, and some of these are more obvious than others, for example: 
• 
building capacity 

• 
number of bedrooms and bathrooms 

• 
internal arrangement of rooms and other spaces 

• 
parking and garages 

• 
aesthetics (design features, choice of materials and use of colour). 



One of the most important factors to consider when planning a building project is the availability of mains services, such as electricity, water and drainage. If all these services are not easily accessible at the site (for example, in rural locations), then it could be expensive to connect to them. This usually involves paying service providers to dig long trenches in the ground to run pipes and cables to the boundary of the cause damage to the natural environment. Special permission may also need to be obtained if this involves working on someone else’s land. 

Even if the proposed new development is on a brownfield site, there is no guarantee that the services provided will be in good order, for example, older water pipes may have low pressure or the water supply may be contaminated if the pipes are made of lead or corroded steel. 
In remote locations where mains water cannot be accessed, a borehole may have to be drilled into the ground to find a natural water source. This can be very expensive, because the depth of the hole and the ground conditions are relatively unknown until the drilling starts, and any water that is found will have to be filtered and purified before use. 
A client may choose to have a self-contained site using alternative energy sources, such as photovoltaic panels for electricity and lighting, ground and air source heat pumps to supply heating and hot water, and storage tanks for sewage. The main benefit of this approach is that it does not rely on the use of finite fossil fuels to generate power, and although the initial installation costs can be quite high, these will be offset with reduced energy bills over a period of time. For more information on energy sources, see Chapter 5. 

Approved Documents 
In many ways, the design of a building and the choice of construction method are influenced by local authority planning restrictions and building regulations. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government publishes guidance on how to comply with building regulations in the form of Approved Documents. These provide general advice on the performance expected of materials and building work, and practical solutions to some of the more common building situations. 
Approved Documents are divided into the key areas listed below: 
• 
Structure: Approved Document A 

• 
Fire safety: Approved Document B 

• 
Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture: Approved Document C 

• 
Toxic substances: Approved Document D 

• 
Resistance to sound: Approved Document E 

• 
Ventilation: Approved Document F 

• 
Sanitation, hot water safety and water efficiency: Approved Document G

Security in dwellings: Approved Document Q 

• 
High-speed electronic communications networks: Approved Document R 

• 
Materials and workmanship: Approved Document 7. 


Listed and heritage building regulations 
Existing buildings may be protected by listed and heritage building regulations. If a building has special architectural or historical interest, not only will the structure of the building be protected, but also any other attached structures or features, including interiors. 
Listed buildings are graded according to their national importance: 
• 
Grade I (one) – buildings of exceptional interest 

• 
Grade II* (two star) – particularly important buildings of more than special interest 

• 
Grade II (two) – buildings of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them. 



If a client wants to alter, extend or change the use of a listed building, they must apply to the local authority for ‘listed building consent’ and be granted permission before any work begins. The grade of listing usually determines what changes can be made and how they should be implemented, although any work will have to be carried out sensitively in order to protect the character and history of the building or structure. 

. Figure 3.12 A listed building 
Traditional versus modern building methods 
It is important during the planning stage of any building project to consider carefully which construction method will be most appropriate. 
Traditional methods of constructing walls, floors and roofs for low-rise buildings have evolved in recent years, in order to meet regulations and building standards on energy efficiency and sustainability. However, this type of construction can be labour­intensive and usually results in longer build times, because the entire superstructure is completed on site with low levels of mechanisation. During the initial stages of the construction work, before the building is watertight, the progress made is often weather dependent, for example, bricklayers cannot lay bricks at temperatures below 2°C or during periods of heavy rain. Traditional construction methods also tend to produce a lot of waste. 

Table 3.2 compares some of the most common traditional and modern construction methods. 
.

Brick and block Cavity Outside Wall tie insulation skin Inside skin  Traditional  • Familiar • Good thermal performance • Good sound insulation • Can be used with concrete upper floors • Good structural performance • Durable • Good fire resistance • Good weather exclusion  • Thick walls due to insulation between inside and outside skin • Takes time to dry out • Cannot be carried out in heavy rain or freezing conditions • Production of cement creates high levels of carbon, which is harmful for the environment  
Open panel – timber frame  Traditional  • Sustainable building material if the timber is from a managed forest • Factory-built framework reduces on-site build times • Good thermal performance and sound insulation (although this is reliant on the infill panels between the open frames)  • Can be more expensive than other building methods • Water can stain the exposed timber in the early stages of construction  
Straw-bale construction (non- Traditional  • Sustainable  • At risk of damage from  
structural/infill system)  • Low cost • Quick to build • Good thermal performance • Good sound insulation • No drying out required  vermin • Increased risk of fire • Uneven wall-surface finishes • Straw rots easily if exposed to moisture  
Panelised – timber frame  Modern  • Manufactured off site in a factory, thereby reducing on-site build times, labour requirements/costs and health and safety risks (for example, working at height) • Quick to erect the shell of the building to make it watertight • Sustainable building material • Good thermal performance • Reduced waste (factory manufactured) • Accurate, easy to adjust and fix to • Thinner walls compared with other methods  • Unable to support concrete upper floors • Long lead time for panels to be made off site • Liable to rot if exposed to moisture

Method of construction  Traditional/ modern  Advantages  Disadvantages  
Insulated concrete formwork (ICF)  Modern  • Excellent thermal performance • Good sound insulation • Good weather exclusion • Durable • Excellent structural performance • Good fire resistance  • Inexperienced workers may need training to use the system • Poor preparation of the formwork (concrete mould) can lead to difficult and expensive repairs once the concrete has been poured and cured  
Steel-frame construction  Traditional  • Quick to erect • Excellent weather resistance • Durable • Excellent structural performance • Could support concrete upper floors • Good fire resistance  • Expensive • Heavy • Requires a crane to lift the steel frame into position • Can distort if exposed to extreme heat (for example, in a fire)  
Thin-joint blockwork/masonry  Modern  • No drying out of mortar joints needed • Quick to build • Excellent weather exclusion • Durable • Excellent structural performance • Fire resistant • Excellent thermal performance • Good sound insulation  • Slightly more expensive compared to traditional bricks and blocks • Accurate foundations needed to build on, because it is difficult to correct blockwork courses at a later stage as the walls are built  
Structural insulated panels (SIPs)  Modern  • Good thermal performance • Manufactured off site in a factory, thereby reducing on-site build times, labour requirements/costs and health and safety risks (for example, working at height)  • Precise foundations required to align the SIPs; any deviation could result in costly delays • Requires a crane to lift the panels into position  
Volumetric (pod/modular)  Modern  • Manufactured off site in a factory, therefore reducing on-site build times, labour requirements/costs and health and safety risks • Better quality control and accuracy maintained in a factory because of the level of automation used  • Initially more expensive • Requires a crane to move the pods into position, which can be expensive to acquire if not already on site  
9781398332874_CH03.indd 98 08/02/22 1:16 PM 



Buildability 
Some modern construction methods involve parts or sections of a building being manufactured away from the site location. Large sections of walls and floors (referred to as cassettes), roof trusses and even whole rooms (known as pods) can be prefabricated more quickly in factories, with better quality control. Production is not delayed due to adverse weather conditions, and off-site factory manufacturing also reduces on-site build times, labour requirements/costs and some health and safety risks. 
This method of combining factory-produced, pre­engineered units (or modules) to form major elements of a structure is referred to as modular construction. It results in improved ‘buildability’, because potential assembly issues are usually designed out at an early stage for ease of construction on site. However, the feasibility of using heavy lifting equipment and cranes on site to lift the large building sections into place, alongside the increased risks to the safety of workers and others, have to be factored into the planning of a project. 



Choosing a method of construction 
It can be difficult deciding whether to construct using 
traditional or modern building methods and materials. Traditional construction generally uses less-sustainable technologies and materials that produce high levels of CO2 during manufacture. However, the costs of maintaining modern methods are normally higher over the lifetime of the building. For more information on sustainable methods of construction, see Chapter 5. 
Whichever method is chosen, it has to meet the minimum standards determined by building regulations. However, some buildings will naturally perform better than others with regards to heat retention and acoustics. The ability of a building to maintain an ambient temperature for its occupants is influenced not only by the U-value of the walls, floors and roof, but also by the construction of doors, windows and roof lights. 

Large windows, roof lanterns and bi-folding or sliding doors are popular features of modern homes. These allow natural daylight to illuminate large areas of the building, providing a feeling of more space and a connection between indoor and outdoor living. 
The direction that a building faces on a plot and the carefully planned positioning of glazing will allow sunlight to warm a building through solar gain (the sun). This heat can also be stored in the fabric of the building during the day and released during the evening, which will reduce reliance on other sources of energy, decrease bills and maintain a comfortable living environment. 
Windows and doors are important design features for access and egress (including for those with disabilities). They are also a means of escape in the event of a fire. In order to maintain the health and wellbeing of the occupants of a building, openings in windows and doors allow for ventilation, whereby stale air is removed from the building and replaced with natural fresh air.

Table 3.3 RIBA Plan of Work Stages and Stage Outcomes 





2.2 Stages and outcomes of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Plan of Work 
The RIBA Plan of Work is a design and process management tool used by the UK building industry to bring greater clarity for the client at different stages of a project. 
It organises the process of briefing, designing, constructing and operating building projects into eight stages. Each stage has intended outcomes, core tasks and information that should be exchanged with different parties. 
In recent years, the Plan of Work has been updated to reflect changes in the industry and to support the government’s target to be net zero carbon by 2050. 
Stage  Outcome  
Pre design  0 Strategic definition  Determine the best way of achieving the client’s requirements and the most appropriate solution.  
1 Preparation and briefing  Develop the client’s concept and make sure it can be accommodated on site. Make sure everything needed for the next stage is in place.  
Design  2 Concept design  Make sure the look and feel of the building is meeting the client’s expectations and budget.  
3 Spatial co-ordination  Design the spaces within the structure of the building, before preparing detailed information about manufacturing and construction.  
4 Technical design  Develop information received from the design team and specialist subcontractors for the manufacture and construction of the building.  
Construction  5 Manufacturing and construction  Manufacture and construct the building.  
Handover  6 Handover  Complete the building works and address any defects that have been identified, to conclude the building contract between the client and the contractor.  
In use  7 Use  The building should be used, operated and maintained efficiently until the end of its life. At this stage, the client may consider appointing professionals for aftercare activities such as servicing and maintenance.

3.1 Key job roles within construction design 
There are many diverse disciplines that contribute to the design and execution of a building project. Each member of the project team is appointed by the client to provide specialist knowledge, skills and services. 
The size of the development often determines how many people are involved, and many of them may have never worked together before. Complex information is communicated throughout the building and design team at various stages in the construction project, therefore it is important that roles and responsibilities are defined clearly at an early stage and recorded in the appointment documentation. 
It is likely that some members of the project team will play only a brief role, and that the structure of the team will change throughout the development. In order to work effectively as a team and in the best interests of the client, communication needs to be clear and efficient, so that everyone is aware of what actions they need to take. 
Let’s look at some of the personnel who could be involved in the design and construction of a development. 
Contractors 
Contractors may be given responsibility by the client to design, plan, organise and control a construction project; this is commonly referred to as ‘design and build’. Under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, a principal contractor must be appointed when there is more than one contractor working on a project. The principal contractor then either appoints designers, or uses one of their own in-house designers, to manage this process as part of their project team. 
The main benefit of this approach is that the client has fewer points of contact to communicate with at each phase of the development. 

Many contractors start out as tradespeople to gain experience of the construction industry, before they progress into supervisory or principal contractor roles to manage building projects for clients. 
Operatives 
Operatives support different tradespeople at every stage of a building project by completing manual labour tasks, such as stacking and storing materials, mixing mortar and tidying the site. The availability of skilled labourers for a construction project and their experience of working with a particular building method may influence the design. 
Skilled general operatives may progress into a trade, and with further experience into supervisory roles such as trade foreperson (there is further information on this role in Chapter 4). 
Architects 
Architects are normally appointed by the client to design new buildings or structures, or to conserve or redevelop old ones. Part of their role is to work closely with clients, the local authority and main contractors to prepare: 
• 
detailed drawings 

• 
specifications 

• 
feasibility studies 

• 
a project brief 

• 
planning applications 

• 
tender documents. 



Architects may also be contracted to: 
• 
prepare other documents, for example, a site waste management plan 

• 
undertake site inspections 


• offer advice to the client at various stages of the building work to resolve any technical difficulties. 
Knowledgeable architects who work within a larger company may progress to a senior position as a lead architect or choose to work for themselves as a freelance consultant. 

. Figure 3.15 An architect using computer-aided design (CAD) 
Planners 
The role of planners is to ensure that land in villages, towns, cities, the countryside and commercial sites is used effectively to meet economic, social and environmental needs. Their objective is to achieve a balance between encouraging innovation and growth in the development of housing, industry, agriculture, recreation and transport while trying to preserve the historical environment. 
Planners can also work as consultants for clients and provide advice on local planning policy to architects and developers. They can consult with stakeholders to determine planning applications, contest appeals and enforce planning legislation. 
Experienced planners may leave the local planning department to become independent, advising contractors and clients on planning and design to meet the local authority’s requirements with regards to planning applications. 
Building control officers/private building inspectors 
Building control officers (BCOs) work for Local Authority Building Control (LABC). Private building inspectors work for government-approved building­inspection companies. Private building inspectors do not have the same powers of enforcement as BCOs, which means that their role may have to be transferred to LABC if there is a problem that cannot be resolved without its intervention. 


The role of the BCO is to inspect plans submitted for full planning approval, making sure they meet current building regulations. At intervals agreed between the BCO and the contractor, they will visit the construction site and check that it meets with regulatory standards of design and safety. 
The progression route for a BCO might involve becoming a member of the local authority planning committee. 


Manufacturers 
Manufacturers are responsible for the design, production and sale of building materials and goods. Before their products are sold and distributed to the end user, they are tested and certified to ensure they adhere to industry standards and regulations (for example, the Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products Regulations 2010). 
Designers may choose certain materials based on their sustainability, eco-design and energy rating, which means that manufacturers can influence the design and use of buildings through their products. 
Mechanical building services (design) engineers 
Mechanical building services (design) engineers consult and advise clients on the design, installation, operation and maintenance of building services such as: 
• 
heating systems 

• 
ventilation systems 

• 
air-conditioning systems 

• 
renewable-energy systems 

• 
sustainable technologies. 


Their technical knowledge of building services may also be utilised by the client for the production of detailed drawings, specifications and calculations to meet with design standards and regulatory requirements. They may be involved in bids and tenders for work, and mentor the client from the start to the completion of a project. 
Electrical building services (design) engineers 
Electrical building services (design) engineers consult and advise clients on the design, installation, operation and maintenance of electrical systems for domestic, commercial and industrial projects, such as: 
• 
lighting systems 

• 
fire-safety systems 

• 
security systems 

• 
renewable-energy systems, for example, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric-car charging points. 


Mechanical design engineers (building services) 
Mechanical design engineers use their specialist knowledge of complex mechanical systems to design, manage and supervise projects for the client, from concept to completion. 
They often work closely with electrical engineers to ensure the design and installation work is carried out safely and in accordance with industry codes of practice. 
Mechanical engineer design co-ordinators 
Mechanical engineer design co-ordinators are usually appointed to assist the mechanical design engineers on larger projects, using their technical expertise to create innovative solutions to building-services problems. They may also organise tendering, project management, reporting and scheduling for the client when required. 

Mechanical engineer CAD technicians 
CAD technicians produce technical information and 2D/3D mechanical diagrams using computer-aided design (CAD). They create manufacturing drawings and work instructions for the building services team. This information is then used to improve the buildability of the project and reduce construction costs for the client. 
BIM designers 
BIM designers work with clients to implement Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM is an intelligent, streamlined process of sharing digital information (for example, 3D models, drawings, specifications and schedules) between all parties and stakeholders. This cost-effective process allows a collaborative approach at every stage of planning, designing, building and managing a project, to improve efficiency and productivity throughout the life cycle of the building. 

Retrofit assessors 
Retrofit assessors assess of existing buildings in order to compile energy efficiency improvement plans for clients. They may also visit sites to: 
• 
resolve issues (for example, maximising the use of PV panels on a building with a complex roof shape) 

• 
review projects 

• 
carry out audits to ensure health and safety and performance standards are being met. 


Retrofit co-ordinators 
Retrofit co-ordinators liaise with retrofit assessors, retrofit installers and clients about the installation of renewable-energy technologies in existing buildings, for example, solar thermal, biomass and air/ground source heat pumps. 
An important part of their role is to gather data from the retrofit assessors, then check its accuracy and produce an improvement plan for the client. The client may also make arrangements for a co-ordinator to appoint an approved installer to carry out the work identified in the plan. 
103 

Retrofit installers 
Retrofit installers (also known as retrofit installer technicians) are responsible for the installation, commissioning and final handover to the client of renewable energy systems and measures. Installers must be PAS 2030:2019 certified and meet these standards on all retrofit projects. 
Competent and experienced retrofit installers may progress in their careers to become retrofit assessors. 



investigated to identify any potential issues early and reduce the risk of additional costs later in the build. 
Individuals or organisations responsible for preparing or modifying designs for construction projects have legal duties under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015. 
Designers must: 
• 
ensure the client is aware of their duties under the CDM Regulations and help them to comply with those duties 

• 
take into account any preconstruction information provided by the client 

• 
eliminate foreseeable health and safety risks where possible 

• 
seek to reduce or control any health and safety risk that cannot be eliminated 

• 
provide design information for inclusion in the health and safety file for the project 

• 
co-ordinate with other designers working on the project on matters of health and safety during the construction phase and beyond 

• 
co-ordinate, communicate and co-operate with all contractors working on the project, taking into account their knowledge and experience of building design. 


Further information on the CDM Regulations can be found in Chapter 1. 
In this section, we will look at the importance of researching and analysing building plots, as well as the process of applying for planning permission, through to the final sign-off of the building work. 

Research 
4.1 Key stages of the design process, and factors that may impact or influence design changes 
House building can be a relatively straightforward process when good design principles are applied, the project has been well planned and there are no unforeseen problems encountered during the construction phase. However, when you are dealing with the natural environment no two sites are ever the same. It is therefore essential that the land is properly Before construction work begins, a desktop survey is usually undertaken to identify and record details about previous and current uses of the site. The main objective of this survey is to support the design and construction processes, by allowing correct decisions to be made when planning the site layout. 


A desktop survey will look to establish the following information: 
• 
site history 

• 
waste records 

• 
geology and hydrology 

• 
contamination reports 

• 
site boundaries 

• 
position of existing services 

• 
existing structures or buildings 

• 
local roads 

• 
access to the site 

• 
topography of the land 

• 
hedges, trees and fences 

• 
wildlife and habitats. 


Much of this information can be gathered from existing plans and records held by the Environment Agency and the Land Registry. 
If a specialist or consultant is appointed, they will also produce an environmental risk assessment. This document is used to identify potential risks to the natural environment from the proposed building work. 
A site of special scientific interest (SSSI) may be identified in the initial survey. This is an area that must be protected from construction activities due to its rare flora or fauna, or its physiographical or geological features. 




Site analysis 
Once the desktop survey has been completed, a walkover survey is usually undertaken. This is a physical inspection of the building site to identify any geological, ecological or topographical issues that may impact the project. 
It involves drilling boreholes into the ground at various positions on the site to investigate the: 
• 
composition of the soil 

• 
load-bearing capacity of the ground 

• 
position of the water table. 


The water table is the point below the ground where the soil becomes saturated; this depth will vary depending on the location of the site. 
The information gathered from the walkover survey is interpreted and used to determine the most appropriate form of foundation to suit the ground conditions. 



Planning 
Under permitted development rights, you can extend or make certain alterations to an existing domestic property without the need for planning permission from the local authority. However, if the proposed changes are beyond the specific limitations of the rules, or new dwellings are to be constructed, then planning permission must be sought and granted. 

The process of making an application for planning approval through to the final decision made by the planning committee can be lengthy and expensive, especially when you consider the investment in time, effort and money in designing the project. 

To improve the efficiency of the application process and reduce any potential financial losses, a pre-planning application should be made to the local planning department. This type of application is usually processed much more quickly than a full application, where detailed drawings and specifications are often needed. Local planning departments encourage pre-applications so that they can offer support and guidance to resolve any issues in the proposal, improving the chance of the final application being successful. 
If planning permission is required for a project, an application must be made to the local authority by the client or planning team, accompanied by a fee and supporting documentation. The design plans for the site will identify the boundary, frontage line and building line. These may be stipulated by the local planning department as a condition of planning approval. 
At this stage, details of the planning application are advertised by the planning department in local newspapers and at the site of the proposal. Consultation letters are sent to neighbours, informing them about the application and advising how they can view the plans online or raise any valid objections to the project going ahead within a period of 21 days from the date of publishing. 


. Figure 3.21 A planning application notice 
During the consultation period, a planning officer from the local planning department will visit the site, where they will take into account information provided in the application and any responses from the public or their representatives. They may also gather further site-specific information, such as measurements and photographs, in order to make their ‘officer’s report’. The planning officer is not responsible for making a planning decision at this stage, but will make recommendations for the authorised person or planning committee to base their final decision on. 
The final outcome for the majority of domestic planning applications is decided by senior officers, under delegated powers from the planning committee. 
There are three possible outcomes for a planning application: 
• 
approved 

• 
approved with conditions that must be complied with (for example, ‘No further windows can be added to the proposal on the east elevation of the property’) 

• 
refused. 


Applications that have been refused can be appealed, however this can be a lengthy and expensive process that is not always successful. 
Construction work can be carried out on domestic buildings by submitting a ‘building notice’ to the local planning department, without the need to submit a full planning application. Although work can start immediately once a building notice has been submitted, lack of detail in the notice could result in the work not complying with building regulations and therefore having to be dismantled or corrected after it has been completed. It is therefore recommended that a building notice is used only for minor building works, or if the contractor has good knowledge of current building regulations.

Approval/review 
Once building work has commenced on site, it must be inspected at regular intervals by either a building control officer (BCO) from Local Authority Building Control (LABC) or a private building inspector. 
The quality and standards of work are checked against building regulations at the following stages: 
• 
excavation of the foundation 

• 
laying of foundation concrete 

• 
installation of damp-proof course (DPC) and damp­proof membranes (DPM) 

• 
laying of drains 

• 
completion of the roof structure 

• 
completion of first-fix installations (before plastering or dry lining) 

• 
testing of drains 

• 
completion of the project. 


Where the standard of work falls below that expected, recommendations are made by the inspector to meet legislation. 
Building regulations state that any person intending to carry out building work must notify LABC to determine stages of work and when they will be inspected. This is known as an ‘inspection service plan’. 
Project sign-off 
As soon as possible after a building project has finished, the contractor or client must notify LABC, so that it can arrange a final visit to the site. During the inspection, the BCO will check that any outstanding actions from previous visits have been completed and verify that the dwelling meets with building regulations. Once satisfied with the building work, they will issue a completion certificate. Until this certificate is issued, a building is not ‘signed-off’ and therefore should not be occupied, and it may be difficult to insure it or secure a mortgage. 

4.2Project planning 
Part of successful planning for a construction project involves scheduling resources, materials and labour for various times throughout the building phase. If this is not given careful consideration at the planning stage, it could result in delays on site, missed completion deadlines and financial penalties for the contractor. 

It is inevitable that certain events during construction work will impact on progress, for example, poor weather, equipment failure or accidents. However, these can be factored into a programme of work as and when they happen, so that adjustments can be made to reduce the impact further down the line. 


Construction scheduling software is often used to prepare programmes of work as part of BIM, because it produces documents that are clear, simple to amend and easy to share with all project stakeholders. 
The most commonly used programmes of work are: 
• 
Gantt charts 

• 
critical path analysis (CPA). 


Gantt charts 
Gantt charts are a type of bar chart. They are used to record the project start and completion times, and the sequence in which construction activities are scheduled to take place in between. Different coloured references are used to: 
• 
highlight planned activity durations 

• 
plot the current status of the project 

• 
flag any amendments that need to be made to complete the project on time and within budget.

Critical path analysis (CPA) 
Critical path analysis (CPA) is a decision-making tool used to plan complex building projects. The order and expected duration of activities are plotted using a networking diagram, connected by a series of node points containing critical information. 

CPA is used by the project management team to identify when each activity can start and opportunities to relocate resources to improve efficiency; these are referred to as ‘float times’.

5.1Life cycle assessment 
Throughout this chapter, we have looked at how design and construction are influenced by different factors, such as legislation, and at the impact building works might have on the natural environment if measures are not taken to protect it. In order to design and construct ‘green buildings’, we need to consider the ‘whole building’ and understand how different construction systems work together and how this can determine project planning. 
The term ‘sustainable home’ is sometimes broadly used when designing or planning; however, not all construction materials perform equally with regards to their carbon footprint. There is increasing demand among stakeholders for more sustainable and energy­efficient buildings, in order to reduce the effects on climate change. It is therefore important to understand the life cycle of construction materials, from their creation to their final use/disposal. 
The impact that construction materials have on the environment can be calculated using a science-based tool known as ‘life cycle assessment’ (LCA). LCA accurately evaluates the effect that materials have at each stage of their life cycle, using data from Building Information Modelling (BIM) and other sources of information, and produces a report. 



. Figure 3.26 Life cycle of building materials 
LCA is a reliable source of data, controlled by international standards. Its findings identify areas in the building design that have the biggest impact on the environment. These areas can then be targeted by designers to alter the design or the materials used, to reduce the environmental impact.

1.1 The construction industry 
Construction is one of the biggest employment sectors in the UK, employing around 3.1 million people, with some of the largest contractors generating annual turnovers of several billion pounds. In 2018, the construction industry contributed £117 billion to the UK economy. 
Construction work is broadly divided into three main categories: 
• 
residential building (housing) 

• 
non-residential building (for example universities) 

• 
infrastructure (civil engineering). 






. Figure 4.3 Infrastructure 
Work in the construction industry involves anything from building and maintaining homes, schools, offices, hospitals and factories to civil engineering projects, such as the creation of roads, bridges and airports. Demand for the construction sector is increasing, with the UK government expected to spend around £600 billion between 2021 and 2031, including £44 billion on residential housing. 


1.2 Business types 
The size and scale of a project often determine which type of organisation is involved. For example, established and experienced contractors with proven track records of similar projects are usually on the preferred suppliers list for tenders. Private clients, who have a smaller amount of money to invest, may appoint subcontractors to complete their building work based on recommendations from previous customers/ clients. 
Outlined below are examples of different business types that may be involved in the construction sector. Further information on business types can be found in Chapter 11, section 1.1 (page 283). 
Sole traders 
A sole trader runs their own business as an individual and is self-employed. They are responsible for keeping financial business records of their sales and expenses. They also have to file a self-assessment tax return with HMRC each year, declare any profits and pay any tax due. Sole traders are personally liable for any debts or losses incurred by the business. 
If annual turnover (sales) exceeds £85,000, the company must become VAT (value added tax) registered with HMRC. It must then charge VAT on all taxable sales it makes to its customers. As of August 2021, the VAT rate is 20 per cent, but this is subject to change. 


Contractors 
Contractors work for a limited company registered with Companies House. Although they are responsible for the affairs and day-to-day running of the company, they have no personal liability for any of its financial losses if things go wrong. Limited companies are given more credibility than other types of business, and their owners also have greater control of their business with tax benefits. 
There are several disadvantages of managing a limited company, including the number of shareholders cannot exceed 50. Setting up a limited company also involves a slightly more complicated process than setting up as a sole trader. To become a limited company, it must first have a suitable business name before paying an administration fee and registering with Companies House. 


Subcontractors 
Subcontractors are self-employed tradespeople who are hired by principal contractors to undertake specific work on building projects. 
Self-employed workers are responsible for every part of running a business, for example estimating, invoicing, ordering and accounts, although they may appoint an accountant to manage some of their financial affairs. They do not receive some of the benefits that employed people enjoy, for example: 
• 
holiday pay (including bank holidays) 

• 
sick pay 

• 
maternity or paternity leave or pay. 


In order to cover the potential losses listed above, subcontractors have to charge their clients more. They also have to consider the days or even weeks that they may be absent through sickness. During these unforeseen periods, the business will cease trading and earning money while the self-employed person recovers. 
Small, medium-sized and large organisations 
An organisation can be privately owned, a partnership or a corporation. Its size can be measured in terms of the number of employees, annual turnover, profits or assets. 
According to Companies House guidance: 
• 
a small organisation employs on average no more than 50 people and has an annual turnover of £10.2 million or less 

• 
a medium-sized organisation employs on average no more than 250 people and has an annual turnover of £36 million or less 

• 
a large organisation employs at least 250 people and has an annual turnover in excess of £50 million. 


Small construction businesses tend to have fewer resources and overheads than larger ones, therefore they often recruit local labour to work within a particular area or region of the country. The bigger an organisation becomes, the more resources it has at its disposal and the further it branches out nationally or internationally to compete for lucrative government or commercial construction contracts. 
The hierarchical structure of personnel within medium-sized and large organisations is much more complex than in smaller businesses. This often causes delays, with information being processed at each level before being filtered down through the organisation. Smaller organisations have a simpler structure, resulting in decisions being made more easily. It is important to establish a hierarchy in an organisation, so that everyone understands lines of communication and areas of responsibility. 


1.3 The range of work undertaken in the construction industry 
The impact of the construction industry is everywhere you look – from homes to public buildings to infrastructure. While structures may be diverse in their design, method of construction and intended purpose, they all illustrate just how much we depend on the construction industry to live, work and travel. 
Construction work usually falls into one of a number of different categories, depending on the client and purpose. Table 4.1 outlines the wide range of work undertaken in the construction industry. 
. Table 4.1 Range of work undertaken in the construction industry 
Category of construction work  Examples of buildings/structures  
Commercial  Offices, private hospitals, hotels and restaurants  
Residential  Private and affordable housing, flats, apartment blocks, retirement villages and student accommodation  
Industrial  Large buildings designed to manufacture goods, for example factories, agricultural buildings, warehouses and power plants  
Health  Health centres, hospitals, clinics, treatment centres and GP surgeries  
Retail  High-street shops, supermarkets, superstores, shopping centres, retail parks and distribution centres  
Recreational  Stadiums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, golf and tennis facilities  
Leisure  Public libraries, amusement parks, fitness centres, spas, cinemas and community centres  
Utilities  Building services systems, for example water, electricity, gas, telecommunications and sewerage  
Transport  Roads, railways, train stations, airports, bridges, footpaths and tunnels  
New build  New housing developments  
Retrofit  Modernisation or adaption of existing buildings to make them more energy efficient and sustainable  



Earlier in this chapter, we highlighted the importance of the construction industry and how the wealth generated from construction developments contributes to the UK economy. 
The industry is showing no signs of slowing down in terms of growth, which creates well-paid job opportunities for skilled workers. Where there are skills gaps or shortages of labour, local and national government often invests heavily in further and higher education, training and skills to meet the demand; however, this can be influenced by the government in power at the time and its priorities. 

When people are employed and have realistic opportunities to progress their careers, they become financially stable and often spend or borrow money to invest in assets such as housing and cars. These investments create more demand for different types of buildings such as housing, transport and better infrastructure, leisure facilities, education establishments and hospitals, which in turn leads to greater employment and continues the cycle. Improvements of this nature in neglected urban areas or areas previously used for industry often lead to the regeneration of whole areas, which increases the value of property, creates employment and reduces crime in the local community. 
The UK government is determined to continue investment in new technologies in the construction sector, to meet the national housing shortage and the need for more affordable homes. It has also made a commitment to tackle climate change and the negative impact that construction has on the environment. 

. Figure 4.6 Gas hob using a finite fossil fuel 
The UK government passed the Climate Change Act in November 2008, setting a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero (carbon neutral) by 2050. To meet this target, the government proposed spending caps and total greenhouse gas emission targets for five-year periods, which should not be exceeded. So far, the country has met each target; however, if it were to miss the carbon budget for an agreed period, it could be challenged in a court of law. 
Changes are being introduced in the construction industry to improve efficiencies and address the need for a cleaner environment, including: 
• 
increased off-site manufacturing to reduce waste and speed up production 

• 
installing smart technologies in homes 

• 
using sustainable building materials 

• 
creating energy-efficient buildings 

• 
installing electric vehicle charging points 

• 
installing alternative heating systems, for example ground and air source heat pumps 

• 
retrofitting existing buildings to improve energy efficiency 

• 
preparing infrastructure for the impact of climate change, for example flood defences 

• 
adapting existing infrastructure to changes in technologies to protect the environment.

4.1 Need/demand 
Construction work often requires huge financial investment by clients at each stage of a project, with an element of risk involved depending on the type of work undertaken. A client that has obtained a building plot without planning permission on it and drawn up proposals with an architect may risk the concept being refused by Local Authority Building Control. However, if planning permission has been granted and there is a demand for the project, it has every chance of being successful. 
Before investing in construction work, it is important to establish the need for the project, in order to mitigate risk and avoid potential financial loss. 
If the proposed project is speculative, with a view to selling or renting the building/s, the client must try to forecast these sales and potential income. It is not uncommon for building work on housing developments to stop if homes are not selling as well as expected, until sales pick up. 
If the work is a government contract for a new school or hospital, then it already has a purpose and does not have to be sold upon completion of the building work. 
4.2Tendering and bidding processes 
Once the design for a project has been approved by Local Authority Building Control, the process of finding a suitable contractor begins. There are several methods the client can use to establish the right contractor for a project, however the following factors need to be considered when deciding on the most suitable procurement method: 
• 
financing and budgets 

• 
time 

• 
quality 

• 
risk 

• 
project limitations. 


The client may already know which contractor they would like to use for their project, based on recommendations from others or having previously appointed them on another project. However, while the client may have total confidence in the contractor’s ability to complete the job to the standards expected, they will not have any comparable quotes from other contractors, and therefore may not be getting the best value for money. 
Open tendering 
The client may invite offers for the contract from anyone, based on the information provided. This is referred to as open tendering. 
The advantage of open tendering is that the process is fair and without bias. However, the client may have to choose a contractor they are not familiar with or one that may not have experience of completing similar projects. The client may have no alternative but to appoint a contractor based on their quotation and references from previous clients. 


Two-stage tender 
If the client would like to secure the services of a contractor early, without having all the relevant design information in place, they can appoint them using a two-stage tender. This involves an agreement with the contractor for work that they are able to price for based on the information provided, so that they are able to start work. At the second stage, when all the design information has been supplied, the contractor is able to negotiate a fixed price for completion of the contract. 
Preferred supplier (selective) 
Clients with previous experience working on similar projects may have developed successful relationships with a range of contractors. Some of these contractors may be included on the client’s list of preferred suppliers. From this list, the client may select a number of contractors and invite them to tender for a contract, although the contractor is not obliged to submit a bid. 
Negotiated tendering 
Where a client has invited just one contractor to price for a project, this is referred to as negotiated tendering. Before building contracts are signed, the client usually negotiates the best price for the work. 

4.3Tender documentation 
The client or client’s representative is responsible for gathering all the documentation needed for the tender package. The same tender package is usually sent to three or four contractors, depending on the tendering process used, so that they can calculate their costs fairly based on exactly the same information, before returning it to the client with their final estimate. 

The information contained in a tender package will be specific to each project. However, it may contain some of the following documents: 
• 
Letter inviting the contractor to submit a bid for the work 

• 
Outline of the proposal 

• 
Form of tender and timeline to return the completed bid 

• 
Form of contract and conditions (including the process for payments and interim valuations) 

• 
Programme of work

•

The contractor is often asked to provide information about their business and previous work they have completed. This will include proof of employer’s insurance and public liability insurance, information about the key personnel that will represent their business on site and references from previous clients. 



It is inevitable that principal design ideas will change as a project develops, until they meet the needs of everyone involved in or affected by the proposal. 
When the architect or client makes changes to a design at an early stage in a development, the implications are usually minor because there are few people involved and the development is still at the drawing-board stage. With each amendment to the design, the architect will add references on the plans and other documentation, so that the client is aware of the most up-to-date versions. 
The more professionals joining the design team and collaborating on a project, the greater the need for the principal designer to keep everyone aware of developments, especially if collaborative technology is not being used to communicate efficiently or effectively. 
Later we will look at the benefits of investing in collaborative working between all stakeholders using technology such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), and how changes in the design can be quickly shared. 
As soon as a project has been given approval and a contractor has been appointed, a building contract will be signed between both parties, stating the terms and conditions of the agreement. Once the legal document has been signed and building work has started, changes are often much more difficult for everyone involved. For example, if the client wanted to include an additional window in a design, it could have the following implications: 
• 
A meeting would need to happen with the client and project team to discuss the proposal. 

• 
An architect would need to be instructed to amend the design. 

• 
Building regulations approval may be needed. 

• 
Subcontractors may be unable to complete the walls, floors and roof. 

• 
The contractor may have to reschedule the subcontractors for a later date, and risk them not being available.

• 
If approval is granted, then the additional window will have to be ordered and made. 

• 
An additional lintel will be required to support the wall above the window. 

• 
Building materials will be wasted. 


All of the implications listed above will cause delays, additional building costs and missed completion dates, which could trigger a financial penalty clause in the building contract. 
If minor amendments can be agreed between the client, architect and contractor without impacting on the schedule or agreed costs, then the architect will issue a written document known as the ‘architect’s instructions’ to formalise the changes. 
If the client or architect makes changes that compromise the terms and conditions of the building contract, then the costs and schedule may have to be renegotiated and agreed in writing before the work is completed. In this situation, an accurate record of the changes and agreement will be made in a document known as a change order, also referred to as a variation order. 


6.1Construction professionals 
A construction professional is someone who is trained and qualified in their chosen field. Training may involve many years of study in order to gain a recognised qualification. They may also be a member of a professional organisation or body. 
For example, an architect will have completed a degree in architecture and be a member of the Architects Registration Board (ARB) or Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). The importance of professional membership is explained later in this chapter. 
Some of the key professional job roles in the construction industry are outlined below. 

Architects 
When a client has a concept for a construction project, they usually appoint a professional architect, also known as a designer, to discuss their ideas, needs and budget. A client’s project could be a new housing development, an extension or alterations to an existing building. It could also involve the restoration or conservation of older buildings of historical interest. 
Architects initially translate information provided by clients and surveys into 2D drawings and 3D digital models, using computer-aided design (CAD). While planning a project, they have a responsibility to protect the environment through their designs, choice of materials and construction methods. 
Initial designs often evolve and include further building documentation, until the client is satisfied that the proposal is ready to be submitted for planning approval if necessary. Design information provided by an architect also informs the BIM process shared with the project team. For example, information from the architect might allow structural engineers to calculate loads and stresses on different parts of a building to determine the size of structural components such as steel beams and foundations. 
An architect could be an individual or organisation; however, where there is more than one architect working on a single project, the client must appoint a principal designer under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015. The role of the principal designer is to lead the project by planning, managing, monitoring and co-ordinating health and safety during the pre-construction phase. 
While there is no requirement to use an architect, their expert knowledge of the construction industry, building regulations and materials makes the design and build process much easier for the client. The client could even extend the services of an architect beyond the design stages to advise them during the building phase and oversee the whole construction project. 


. Figure 4.14 Architect 


Civil engineers 
Civil engineers are also classified as designers, although they manage the design, construction and maintenance of infrastructure rather than buildings. Typically, they are involved in projects such as: 
• 
roads 

• 
bridges 

• 
tunnels 

• 
airports 

• 
harbours 

• 
railways 

• 
water and sewage systems 

• 
power plants. 



. Figure 4.16 Civil engineering 
There are many different subdisciplines in civil engineering. People usually specialise in one of the following fields: 
• 
transportation engineering 

• 
structural engineering 

• 
environmental engineering 

• 
geotechnical engineering 

• 
hydraulic engineering 

• 
construction engineering. 


As civil engineers are responsible for the design and implementation of infrastructure in construction projects, their collaboration with other professionals in the design and construction team is vital to the success of any project. 

Building services design engineers 
Building services design engineers consult and advise clients on the concepts and possible approaches that could be integrated into their buildings to supply the following services: 
• 
heating 

• 
ventilation 

• 
air conditioning 

• 
renewable energy, for example solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric car charging points 

• 
sustainable technologies 

• 
lighting 

• 
fire and security systems. 



. Figure 4.18 Renewable energy 
Their technical knowledge of building services may also be utilised by the client for the production of detailed drawings, specifications and calculations to meet with design standards and regulatory requirements. They may also be involved in bids and tenders for work and advise the client from start to completion of a project. 
Building services engineer technicians 
Building services engineer technicians are responsible for: 
• assisting the project team with design solutions, specifications and planning for building services engineering systems (for example water and drainage, lighting and power) 

• 
supervising specialist contractors during installations 

• 
taking the lead on health and safety 

• 
commissioning systems while minimising the impact construction work has on the environment 

• 
monitoring quality control, recording progress and reporting to the project team during installations. 



Building services engineering site managers 
Building services engineering site managers oversee the installation of complex environmental systems in construction projects, such as heating, lighting and electrical power. During the construction phase, they work closely with the project team to make sure the design information is understood, in order to maintain quality and productivity during installation on site. 
. Figure 4.19 Building services engineer 
Facilities managers 
Facilities managers take responsibility for the operation, servicing and maintenance of building services once the building work has been completed, signed-off and handed over to the client. When contractors are needed for work on the systems, the facilities manager will prepare tender documents, schedule repairs and monitor work under their control to minimise disruption and protect people from work activities. 
Client representatives 
It is not always possible or practical for the client to be on site all of the time during the construction phase of a project, and their technical knowledge about the building industry may be limited. Consequently, either the principal designer or the client will appoint a clerk of works (CoW). 

The CoW acts as the client’s representative on site to oversee the quality and safety of work on the project. In the interests of the client, they work closely with the construction staff, surveyors and engineers to make sure plans and specifications are followed properly. In doing so, the CoW will refer to working drawings, building regulations and health and safety legislation. Where standards have not been achieved in terms of the quality of work, materials or safety, the CoW will report to the site manager and make suggestions for improvement. 
As progress is made throughout the construction phase, the CoW will keep the client informed with accurate reports/records from the site, at intervals agreed at the start of the project. 
Contract managers 
Contract managers are employed by contractors to assist in preparing tenders for clients and securing future business. When tender bids have been accepted by a client, a legal contract is drawn up by the contract manager. The terms and conditions of the contract are negotiated with the client and other stakeholders with regards to budget, the service that will be provided and project timescales. The contract manager is usually the main point of contact for the client and the site/project managers for the duration of the project. 
Once construction work has started on site, the contract manager will monitor progress against the agreed schedule and technical standards by attending regular site meetings with the management team. Where unexpected costs arise or the terms of the contract change during the project, the contract manager will have to resolve these issues as quickly and effectively as possible. 
Site managers 
Site managers, also known as site supervisors, are responsible for organising work on construction sites to ensure it is completed safely, on time and within the client’s budget. They are usually based in a temporary site office and will remain on site throughout the construction phase of the project to organise labour, equipment and materials for each stage of the build. 
Site managers: 
• 
supervise workers, subcontractors and visitors, for example delivery drivers 

• 
monitor the quality of work and the progress made against the programme of work 



• take responsibility for the health, safety and welfare of workers and others that may be affected by work activities; this involves making arrangements to protect people from harm and ensuring workers are suitably trained and informed about risks and control measures, usually through a site induction. 
Health and safety standards are closely monitored by the site manager against risk assessments, method statements and health and safety legislation, and where necessary they will take action to maintain or improve safety on site. 
Throughout the construction phase, the site manager will liaise with other professionals, such as the quantity surveyor to discuss budgets and the architect or surveyors regarding design issues or amendments. They may also have to deal with accidents, near misses or other emergency situations. 
While key information on progress and budgets can quickly be communicated through the project team using collaborative methods, regular site/progress meetings are often chaired by the site manager. 


6.2Construction operatives 
Most construction operatives are experienced and skilled workers that specialise in a particular area of the building industry. The level of qualifications and registrations needed to become a tradesperson are often determined by the occupation, however the most widely recognised are National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs, SNVQs in Scotland) and Apprenticeship Standards. 
In addition to these qualifications, construction operatives may also need a current CSCS card to demonstrate to their employer that they have the minimum level of health and safety knowledge to work safely on site; the CSCS card scheme is covered in more detail in Chapter 1. 
Carpenters and joiners 
Carpenters and joiners both work with wood: 
• 
Joiners are usually based in a workshop, where they manufacture purpose-made items to order, for example doors, windows, frames and staircases, using a range of machinery, power tools and hand tools. 

• 
Carpenters usually work on construction sites. First-fix carpentry includes the installation of floors, roofs, walls and stairs, and second­fix carpentry involves the fitting of skirting, architraves, doors and kitchens. 


Carpenters and joiners both work from drawings and specifications provided by the design team; however, they may need to gather further information from the management team during a site visit before they begin any manufacturing off site. 
see attached image 04_22

. Figure 4.22 Carpenter 



Plasterers 
Plasterers are tradespeople used by contractors to apply smooth and textured finishes to internal walls and ceilings, using a range of materials such as gypsum, cement or lime. Highly skilled plasterers also have the ability to carry out repairs or cast ornamental mouldings in plaster to match existing period features in a property. Plasterers can also apply smooth or textured finishes to external walls, using lime, cement or flexible modern materials such as polymer or acrylic renders. 
Plasterers can usually start to apply finishes to the internal walls and ceilings as soon as tradespeople have completed the installation of their respective first­fix items. Where work is needed externally, this is often weather dependent, unless the work is under cover or protected, therefore plasterers will often work closely with the site manager to schedule this type of work when the weather permits. 


. Figure 4.24 Gypsum plaster 
Tilers 
Tilers may be subcontracted by the principal contractor to lay decorative and protective wall and floor tiles. Tiles can be ceramic, clay, marble, slate or glass and are available in a range of different sizes, shapes, designs and textures. 
A tiler will often calculate, cut and lay tiles in kitchens and bathrooms, as areas most exposed to high levels of moisture. A tiler could also be appointed to work outdoors to lay tiles on patios, terraces or swimming pools. These tasks will be completed in the final stages of a project, to protect the areas from damage from other building work. 
Bricklayers 
Bricklayers set out, build and repair walls, piers and archways for domestic and commercial projects. They work from plans and design specifications to calculate costs for clients and quantities of materials needed. 
Bricklayers can build single as well as double cavity walls using a range of different bricks, blocks or stone, for internal or external projects. Their job is very physical and often involves working at height using a range of access equipment; therefore, it is essential that they have a strong understanding of health and safety practices. 
The stages at which bricklayers are scheduled into a project are determined by the build method chosen. However, the majority of their work is often structural, which would result in them being on site once the foundations have been poured. 

. Figure 4.25 Bricklayer 
Plumbers 
Plumbers install, maintain and repair water, heating and drainage systems in new and existing buildings. This includes cutting, shaping and fixing pipes and fixtures for the installation, testing and commissioning of the following: 
• 
hot and cold running water 

• 
heating systems 

• 
baths 

• 
sinks 

• 
toilets 

• 
showers 

• 
dishwashers and washing machines. 


During the first-fix stage of work, plumbers prepare for the installation of services on site by fitting pipework. In domestic projects, pipework is run through floors, walls and ceiling voids where possible, so that it can be hidden from view. On other projects, such as industrial or commercial, the specification may state that pipework has to be located in surface-mounted ducting, so that it can easily be maintained or adapted without causing damage. 
At the second-fix stage, plumbers must work closely with other trades to co-ordinate the installation of fixtures and fittings, to protect them from damage and to avoid complications for work that follows. 

. Figure 4.26 Plumber 
Electricians 
Electricians are responsible for designing, installing, servicing and repairing electrical systems in new and existing buildings. At the first-fix stage, electricians interpret wiring diagrams and the client’s specification to run the wiring system throughout the building to power lighting, sockets and alarm systems. Later in the project they will be scheduled by the project manager to return to site to install/connect the second­fix electrical fixtures and fittings, for example the fuse board, light fittings and switches. 
Once the system has been installed, the electrician will test and commission it to make sure it is safe to put into service. If a new electrical system has been fitted, the electrician will issue the client with an Electrical Installation Certificate (EIC) to show that it has been installed to a satisfactory standard. If the electrician has carried out work on an existing system, they will issue the client with a Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate (MEIWC) to demonstrate that the work they have completed is safe. 
Heating and ventilation fitters 
Heating and ventilation fitters plan, install and maintain large heating and ventilation systems. They follow the designer’s plan and specification to ensure work is completed safely to industry standards and to meet the client’s requirements. 
Once the installation work has been completed, the heating and ventilation fitter will test and commission the system. At the end of the project, they may be appointed by the client to carry out routine servicing of the system, to ensure it is working safely and efficiently. Any work completed by the fitter must be recorded in the client’s building log book. 

Gas fitters 
A gas fitter specialises in the installation, servicing and maintenance of gas systems and appliances. Once all the structural work has been completed on a project, the first-fix installation of the new system can begin. The gas fitter follows the prepared design drawings and specifications to route their gas pipework safely through the building, where it is least likely to be damaged by other construction work. 
At the second-fix stage, the gas fitter connects the client’s appliances and pressure tests the system to check for leaks, before connecting to the main gas supply entering the construction site. 
Once the gas fitter has completed all the safety checks and is satisfied that the work has been completed safely to building regulations, they will commission the system. It is then the responsibility of the gas fitter to inform their local authority of the installation within 30 days, so that a Building Regulations Compliance Certificate can be issued to the client. 


. Figure 4.28 Gas Safe logo 
Decorators 
Decorators are usually one of the last trades to be scheduled during a construction project. Part of their role is to prepare surfaces such as walls, ceilings, metal and woodwork for decorative and protective finishes. Some of these finishes can be applied internally or externally with brushes, rags, sponges, rollers or spray systems. Skilled decorators can also apply other finishes, such as hanging wallpaper, stencilling, graining and creating marbling effects. 

Trade supervisors 
Trade supervisors are often experienced construction workers who have progressed from their chosen profession to a supervisory role, where they are responsible for a small team of tradespeople working on a particular project. In most situations, they remain ‘on the tools’ throughout the building phase, while managing the standard of work, resources and health and safety of operatives under their control. 
Trade supervisors may be required to attend scheduled site meetings with the construction management team to represent their trade area, report their progress and raise any concerns that they are unable to resolve themselves. 
Non-skilled operatives 
Non-skilled operatives usually undertake manual­labouring tasks to support tradespeople and other skilled workers on site, such as preparing building materials, moving equipment and general housekeeping to keep people safe. They play an important role in the success of any construction project. 







7.1 Role of CPD 
Construction and building services engineering are fast-moving industries, and the people working within them must keep pace with any new developments. 
Professionals and skilled operatives beginning a career in the sector must undertake training and demonstrate competence in order to achieve formal qualifications. These achievements often create employment opportunities, allowing those new to the industry to gain valuable work experience and develop a greater understanding of their job role. 
Some professionals and operatives have legal responsibilities to belong to professional, accredited or certified organisations in order to actively continue with their job roles, for example gas fitters have to keep a yearly registration with Gas Safe. This often involves having to maintain professional standards and keep records of continuing professional development (CPD). 
Many businesses insist on employees maintaining professional CPD and outline workforce planning in contracts of employment or codes of practice. There is further information on chartered, professional, accreditation and certification bodies in Chapter 7. 

Often people working in the construction industry have to undertake CPD to demonstrate the currency of their professional competence. For this reason, they may focus on a particular area of weakness that they have identified or that has been brought to their attention, such as: 
• 
legislation and regulations 

• 
management and supervision 

• 
health, safety and welfare 

• 
digital technology 

• 
conservation and refurbishment 

• 
sustainability 

• 
maintenance 

• 
tools and equipment 

• 
industry standards and best practice. 



7.2 Types of CPD 
CPD does not have to be the completion of onerous formal qualifications at another organisation. Examples of CPD include: 
• 
work experience 

• 
a short bespoke training session taught in-house by an employer or external training provider 

• 
an on-site toolbox talk presented by a site manager on a particular topic of health and safety 

• 
a self-learning online course. 


7.3 Benefits of CPD 
CPD is a legal requirement for some professionals. However, there are also many benefits for employers and individuals in upskilling, including: 
• 
protecting clients, customers and the public 

• 
keeping up to date with the latest regulation changes, product developments and technological advancements 

• 
developing product knowledge 

• 
working more efficiently 

• 
improving knowledge and skills 


• 
enhancing the company image 

• 
career progression. 



. Figure 4.31 Construction workers updating their CPD 
Businesses that actively encourage employee CPD will not only have a highly skilled and professional team, but also members of staff that are committed and remain loyal. The more businesses invest time, money and effort in the development of their staff, the safer and more skilled the building industry will become as a whole. 


Building Information Modelling (BIM) uses smart technology to allow effective and efficient collaboration between designers and the construction team at every stage of a building project. It is adaptable to suit the size and complexity of each project and allows technical information to be shared throughout the management and construction teams. 


. Figure 4.32 Building Information Modelling (BIM) 
8.1 BIM process 
At the start of a project, the client usually meets with the designer and contractor to discuss the information they want to receive at each stage up until handover, and how this will be shared with them through BIM. This detail is recorded in a document known as the Employer’s Information Requirements (EIR), so that the construction team understands the service it needs to provide to the client. 
Designers usually start the BIM process by translating information captured from the construction site and the client’s drawings into digital 3D models of the building and the infrastructure around it. Clients and other stakeholders can use BIM for virtual-reality tours throughout the building before it has been constructed, helping them to gain a better understanding of the structure. 
BIM illustrates every detail of the project in graphical form (drawings) and non-graphical form (written information), recording the relationships between components and how they all fit together. This information can be shared easily with all members of the project team, so that they can analyse every aspect of the design, and where necessary make changes to the model in real time. 
BIM brings different professionals together to show how their work fits into the overall project by analysing data and exploring visualisations to help understand how a building is to be constructed. Working collaboratively on complex building projects using BIM can eliminate mistakes before they happen, save costs and achieve better project outcomes. 
At the design stage, the intelligent model process is used to generate documentation for construction specifications and schedules for the building phase of the project, referred to as the Digital Plan of Work (DPoW). During the building phase, this information is used by the contractor and subcontractors to inform planning and organise resources for an efficient site, and ensure the smooth running of the project. 
Another advantage of BIM is that it can be accessed by any member of the project team on the construction site using a mobile device, and it is often used with augmented reality (AR) technology. In AR, digitally generated images are superimposed over real-world images in real time. This technology is useful for building services engineers when planning the arrangement of services, such as air-conditioning ducts and vents. 



8.2BIM levels 
The extent to which BIM is used will vary, depending on the nature and size of a project. The government recognises the positive steps the construction industry has taken towards the adoption of BIM and how it has contributed to substantial savings. It also understands the complexity of BIM and how it could be used broadly to describe many different systems. 
To bring clarity to how BIM is used in a project, the government has defined a number of levels: 
• 
Level 0 – Designers are using computer-aided design (CAD) to produce 2D drawings and plans, however this information has to be printed to be shared with the project team. There is no digital collaboration between stakeholders using the same platform. 

• 
Level 1 – A Common Data Environment (CDE) is established, usually by the contractor, allowing graphical and non-graphical information to be stored centrally and accessed by the whole project team. CAD is used in the production of 2D drawings, 3D BIM models and other construction documentation. Clear roles and responsibilities are established in the project team, and common forms of data are used to share information between different parties. 

• 
Level 2 – Any CAD software can be used at this level, but it must be capable of being exported to common file formats. The project team will also be able to work collaboratively using different systems throughout a construction project. This is the minimum level required by the government for all public construction projects. 

• 
Level 3 – This level is in its preliminary stages of development, however it is intended to improve on level 2 BIM with the use of a single server. This will allow an ‘open data’ standard, so that all stakeholders are able to work simultaneously on the same project, from anywhere in the world. 



. Figure 4.34 BIM: 2D computer-aided design (CAD) 
8.3Data warehouse 
Once a building project has been completed, contractors usually measure its success by analysing data and project outcomes. Besides the technical information distributed through BIM, contractors usually want to focus on particular subject areas, such as the procurement of resources or finance. In order to do this successfully, the most recent information is gathered from different sources and fed into a single digital storage system known as a data warehouse. 
Data warehouse software systems are designed to meet the needs of each contractor by structuring the information, evaluating it and presenting visual reports. Harnessing the data in this way enables the contractor to make informed business decisions for future construction projects. 


There are many internal and external factors that can affect the way a business is controlled. Some of these factors can be planned for and managed, however there are some that are beyond the control of the business and will inevitably happen. 

It is important that businesses develop strategies to prepare for these factors before they happen, by analysing their market from many different angles and the environment as a whole. 
Factors that are beyond the control of a business are known by the acronym PESTLE: 
• 
Political – political situations could affect local and national government spending in the construction sector, for example a change of government. 

• 
Economic – 

– 
If people are not spending money, the UK economy will slow down. When this happens, the building industry is one of the first to be impacted. 

– 
Changes in gross domestic product (GDP) value and exchange rates will affect the market value of construction goods and services. 

– 
When interest rates increase, people are more likely to save rather than spend their money. If interest rates decrease, people will often borrow money to spend on new homes or invest in improvements to their existing properties. 

– 
Higher taxation also has an impact on businesses and the self-employed, because it results in increased costs of building materials and labour. 



• 
Social – population demographics and the movement of social and community groups can influence the type of buildings and structures constructed in particular areas to meet the needs of the community. 

• 
Technology – technological innovations could affect how a building or structure is designed and constructed, for example the use of green energy as a source of power. 

• 
Legal – legislation made by Parliament can influence the planning, design and construction of buildings. For example, following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 there was a review of the Building Regulations 2010 and Approved Document B (Fire safety), effectively banning the use of combustible cladding in external walls of relevant high-rise buildings. 

• 
Environment – companies have corporate social responsibility (CSR) and protect the environment by lowering carbon emissions produced during manufacturing and construction.

At every stage of a construction project, people have to collaborate to share different types of information. If these lines of communication are not efficient, or the information is not clear, it could be detrimental to the project in terms of mistakes and financial implications. While verbal communication is quick and effective in many situations, it can be misunderstood or forgotten, and there is nothing to refer back to at a later date or if a dispute occurs. 
In the construction industry, important information is recorded in different types of written documentation. It is advantageous to record information in this way because it is clear, understood by everyone and can easily be duplicated and distributed at various levels in the project team. 
Other than health and safety documentation (which is covered in Chapter 1), the following documents are commonly used in construction projects: 
• 
take-off sheets 

• 
contracts 

• 
schedule of rates 

• 
estimates 

• 
quotations 

• 
delivery notes 

• 
purchase orders 

• 
bills of quantities 

• 
wiring diagrams. 


10.1 Take-off sheets 
To calculate quantities of building materials and labour costs for a construction project, estimators complete take-off sheets (also referred to as material take-off) using information contained in working drawings and specifications. 
While this estimation process may not be necessary for small construction jobs, it is always used for major projects to determine their feasibility, as well as being a financial planning tool. Take-off sheets are also used by estimators to produce bills of quantities for the tendering process, and to support bids for future contracts. 
Take-off sheets can be completed manually, referring to hard copies of drawings to determine measurements and quantities using a scale rule. However, this is reliant on the methodical approach of an estimator and is at risk from human error. Accurate take-off sheets can be created using computer software, providing estimates that can easily be shared between the office and construction sites. 
Requisitioning materials necessary for a construction project from take-off sheets can result in workers getting the resources they need on time, for smoother running of the job. 

10.2Contracts 
Lump-sum and measurement contracts 
Once a client has decided which contractor they are going to appoint for a project, either through the tendering process or otherwise, they can formally secure their services with a lump-sum contract. A lump sum is a fixed price for the project based on drawings, specifications and the bill of quantities (see below). 

If a lump sum cannot be accurately determined by the contractor before work starts on site, a measurement contract may be used. This type of contract is based on agreed values or rates (prices) for work between the client and the contractor, where the total cost is not finalised until the end of the project. 
When neither of these options can be used, a contract can be agreed for work to be completed on the understanding that the client will be charged the prime cost of the materials, labour and plant for the project, plus an additional fee to cover the contractor’s profit margin and overheads. This is known as a cost­reimbursement contract. The extra charges added to the prime cost can be based on a percentage of the overall project value, or a fixed sum of money decided before the contract is agreed. 
Where the services of a contractor may be required for design and build, management only or construction management purposes, other forms of contract can be designed to suit these requirements.

. Figure 4.37 Take-off sheets 

When both parties have agreed to the terms and conditions of a contract, they will sign it in the presence of a witness to complete the legally binding document. This is known as an agreement. 

. Figure 4.38 Building contract 
Payment schedule 
An important part of the terms and conditions of any building contract is the payment schedule. This determines how and when the client will pay the contractor for the agreed work. Where minor works are undertaken for a short duration, one payment could be agreed to be made at the end of the project. However, for bigger contracts payments are usually made regularly throughout the project until completion. 
Without interim payments, the contractor will have to finance the client’s project by paying labour, materials and plant for the duration of the contract, which could cause cash-flow problems. Payments can be agreed to be made in advance of each significant stage of building work, for example: 

• 
the first payment when the contracts have been signed 

• 
the second payment when the foundations are built and inspected 

• 
and so on for each stage of the project. 


Most clients prefer to pay contractors interim payments for work completed. This reduces the risk for the client if the contractor is unable to complete the project after payments have been made. 
Retention 
Clients sometimes withhold a percentage of money due to the contractor at each stage of the building work; this is known as a retention. The exact percentage of money to be withheld has to be agreed between the client and contractor before work starts and is usually 3–5 per cent. The retention acts as financial security for the client, to make sure the contractor finishes the building work and any snagging within a reasonable amount of time after completion of the work; this is known as the defects liability period. 
If the contractor does not return to complete the work within the period agreed in the contract, the client has reasonable grounds to use the money to instruct other contractors to undertake the outstanding work. On the other hand, if the contractor does complete the project and resolve all of the defects identified within the defects liability period, the client must release the outstanding retention payment without delay. 


Penalty clauses 
To ensure a building project is completed by the date stipulated in the contract, a penalty clause is usually included. In the event that the contractor does not finish the agreed work by the completion date, a sum of money will be owed to the client by the contractor. This amount will increase with every day past the original deadline, until the project is completed. 
Other documents 
There are various other documents included in a contract between a client and a contractor, which may include: 
• 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) 

• 
working drawings 

• 
specifications 

• 
a schedule of work. 


10.3 Schedule of rates 
The cost of building materials will naturally increase over a long period of time due to inflation. However, it can also quickly rise above this level if there is an increase in transport costs or demand and a shortage of materials. 
When prices for materials are not stable, it can cause difficulties for contractors and subcontractors in the period between pricing or tendering for contracts and actually starting the projects when purchase orders are placed. 
So that contractors are not caught out by price increases, suppliers often agree a schedule of rates for a set period of time. This allows contractors to determine more accurate quotations for clients, without having to overcompensate for unforeseen price increases after they have submitted their fixed price for work. 
10.4Estimates 
An estimate is a prediction of costs for building work provided by contractors for clients, based on all the information provided for a job. Although there has to be a degree of accuracy in an estimate, there are factors that are liable to change after the costs have been finally calculated, which could lead to additional charges once the work has been completed. 

When a client is considering the affordability of a project, they may not be able to provide all the information needed by the contractor, for example the final details of finishes. A percentage of money is usually added to the estimate as a contingency, to cover any unknown financial risk until more information becomes available. 




10.5Quotations 
A quotation is different to an estimate; this is a fixed price for goods and services offered by contractors or subcontractors to potential clients. Once a quotation has been agreed in writing between both parties and work has started on site, the price cannot be amended, even if this means that the contractor has underestimated their work. To avoid disputes over money between the client and contractor at the end of the project, it is important that the quotation details exactly what services and goods are being provided. 
Most written quotations have an expiry time, for example 30 days from the date provided, after which time the quote is no longer valid. If this date is not stipulated on the document, then the cost of construction materials and overheads may increase due to increased transport costs or demand, which could reduce profit margins for the contractor. Where the client is responsible for a sizable project, they will often request quotations from different contractors as part of the tendering process. 


10.6 Delivery notes 
A delivery note is a document that accompanies a shipment from a supplier and describes the goods and quantities being delivered. 
When goods are delivered to site, the delivery driver will ask for a dated signature on the delivery note from a responsible person, confirming that the correct items have been received in good condition and that they match the original purchase order. Any damaged or missing goods must be recorded on the delivery note before signing it or allowing the driver to leave. Defects or missing goods unreported when a delivery is made are much more difficult to justify to the supplier or put right at a later date. 
While the format for delivery notes varies between different suppliers, the information contained on them is basically the same and includes: 
• 
purchase order number or reference 

• 
purchaser’s name or company 

• 
delivery address • order date 

• 
item reference/description 

• 
quantities 

• 
sizes 

• 
signatures of the delivery driver and recipient 

• 
delivery date. 


While paper delivery notes are still used by many suppliers of construction materials, some use electronic pads for signatures, with receipts emailed afterwards. This avoids the need to store the documents on site where they could get lost or damaged, as well as providing a digital copy of the delivery note that can easily be stored.

. Figure 4.42 Delivery note 
Neither version of delivery notes contains individual prices, nor the total cost for the goods; those details are sent to the purchaser’s business address on an invoice. Contractors that have credit accounts with suppliers will receive an invoice after each delivery or collection of goods. At the end of each month, the contractor will receive a statement listing each invoice number and cost, amounting to the total money due for that period. 

10.7Purchase orders (POs) 
To keep control of spending and budgets, contractors usually set up a credit agreement with their suppliers. Only then can goods be ordered with an official purchase order from the contractor or their nominated employees, for example a buyer. Hard­copy purchase orders can be used, although these are often much slower to process than electronic versions, which can be emailed directly to the supplier without delay. 
Before issuing a purchase order, the contractor or their buyer will usually negotiate the best prices for the goods or services with different suppliers, until they are satisfied that they have value for money. 
All purchase orders have a unique reference number or code that links them to a particular job or contract. The same references are then used by suppliers on their delivery notes and invoices. This makes it easier for the contractor to assign money actually spent on resources for a job against estimates and quotations; it also prevents unauthorised purchases from suppliers. 

10.8 Bill of quantities (BoQ) 
A bill of quantities is a document usually produced for the client by a quantity surveyor at the planning stage of a building project. It contains a list of all the quantities of materials and resources needed to complete the work, measured in number, length, area, volume or time. 
The bill of quantities is part of tender documentation, allowing potential contractors to provide itemised costs for work based on the same specified quantities (rather than taking off quantities from drawings and specifications). The client is then able to compare easily both the overall cost and individual item costs between tenderers. 
The bill of quantities is not just used for cost planning file, and they should be kept for the lifetime of the during the tendering process, but also later for building. They can be referred to at a later date during construction planning, material scheduling and the any further building work, or during the repair or valuation of interim payments for the contractor. maintenance of the electrical system.

. Figure 4.43 Bill of quantities (BoQ) 

10.9Wiring diagrams 
Wiring diagrams are technical drawings provided by the client to building services engineers, such as electricians, for the installation of electrical systems and circuits. They are simplified visual representations of the layout of electrical systems or circuits. They show how electrical wires are interconnected and where fixtures such as switches, sockets and lighting components are positioned, both internally and externally on every level of the building. Symbols, abbreviations and notes are used on the diagrams to indicate the incoming power source, explain how components relate to one another and provide other important information such as voltages and ratings, as well as the size and capacity of the system. 
At the end of the project, the wiring diagrams are handed over to the occupants in the health and safety 


11.1Snagging 
After the subcontractors have completed the building work for a project, the site management team will complete a rigorous inspection for defects and record any that they find on a document known as a snagging list. The defects identified could be minor, such as a scuff mark on paintwork or a door binding in its frame, or something more serious, for example the drainage system not working. 
Once the list has been completed, the contractor usually instructs the relevant subcontractors to rectify the defects at their own expense. Once all the defects have been resolved to a satisfactory standard, the property is ready to hand over to the client. 

11.2Handover package 
Besides the simple act of handing over the keys or fobs (an alternative to keys, used for keyless entry) for a property to the client, the contractor is also responsible for the smooth transition from construction to ownership. 
To maintain a consistent approach for this process, the site management team usually has a checklist of key points that the client must understand so they can be confident using the building and operating the services within it. 
Part of the handover process involves a member of the site management team walking the client through the building, demonstrating the use of essential services and appliances such as heating, hot and cold water and electricity for lighting. The client will also be provided with a handover package containing a number of essential documents: 
• 
the building owner’s manual and user guide 

• 
guidance documents on defects reporting and 

aftercare • operational and maintenance manuals 

• 
a building regulations completion certificate 

• 
the health and safety file (including construction drawings/BIM) 

• 
the building log book 

• 
testing and commissioning certificates, for example a Building Regulations Compliance Certificate for gas installations 

• 
the building warranty/insurance certificate and policy booklet. 


Once the occupant has taken ownership of a property, they may discover small faults with the standard of work or the quality of materials used. In this case, the owner would follow the information in the handover package to compile their own snagging list and report the faults directly to the contractor so that they can put them right. 

. Figure 4.44 Handover 
11.3 Health and safety file 
The Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) Regulations 2015 place a legal duty on the designer (or the principal designer, where there is more than one) to produce a health and safety file for projects they have worked on. 
The file is prepared during the pre-construction phase of a project and contains relevant health and safety design information that may be used by the contractor in the construction phase, and again once the project is completed, when further work may be carried out on the building, for example servicing, maintenance and alterations. 
A copy of the health and safety file should remain with the property owner and be available for reference for the lifetime of the building. 


11.4 Log book 
In order to comply with building regulations and Approved Document L2A, the handover package for a new building (other than a domestic property) given to the client must contain a building log book. 
The log book is a management tool that contains information about the services in the building and how they can be operated properly and efficiently. If any changes are made to the original design of the building, the details must be updated in the log book by the facilities manager or others responsible for the management of the building.

11.5Insurance schemes 
Most contractors provide the client with a warranty to protect them against the builder becoming insolvent and problems occurring in the building within the first ten years. There are three approved insurance schemes widely recognised and used by contractors in the construction industry: 
• 
Local Authority Building Control (LABC) Warranty 

• 
Premier Guarantee 

• 
National House Building Council (NHBC) Buildmark Warranty. 


When one of these policies has been implemented by the contractor, the building work will usually be inspected at various stages by the insurance company to make sure it adheres to standards of work and materials. 
The advantage of choosing LABC Warranty is that it works in partnership with Local Authority Building Control. This avoids having more than one body inspect the building work and can be a cheaper option. 
Like most building warranties, the Premier Warranty offers a ten-year cover period following completion. This is split into two periods – the defects insurance period, which covers the first two years, and the structural insurance period, which covers years three to ten. 
The disadvantage of both these policies is that the client must pay an excess of £1000 for each claim, therefore the majority of new homes are covered by the NHBC Buildmark Warranty. Buildmark provides insurance for new or converted homes from exchange of contracts to a maximum of ten years after legal completion. 

. Figure 4.46 National House Building Council (NHBC) logo 

11.6Storage of documents 
Many of the documents included in the handover package must be stored safely by the client for the lifetime of the building, in order to comply with legal requirements. For example, fire safety information must be kept in order to meet regulation 38 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. 
An effective way to do this is to store the documents in an online repository, where they can be accessed and managed by the occupiers, Local Authority Building Control or emergency services when they are needed. 
Various companies offer to store building documentation online in a digital format, known as a ‘building passport’.

1.1Sustainability 
When planning and delivering a construction project, sustainability is achieved by: 
• 
using renewable and recyclable resources 

• 
sourcing materials locally 

• 
protecting resources 

• 
reusing and refurbishing materials 

• 
reducing energy consumption and waste 

• 
creating a healthy and eco-friendly environment 

• 
protecting the natural environment. 



1.2Assessment methods 
Various assessment methods are used to determine how well a building performs against environmental, social and economic standards. Buildings are evaluated according to regional, national and global criteria, to assist architects and planners during the design stages of a project. 
Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) 
The Building Research Establishment (BRE) has created best practice standards for the environmental performance of buildings through their design, specification, construction and operation. BREEAM sets out benchmarks for standard categories of development and also offers a scheme for non­standard buildings. The assessment method can be applied to both new developments and refurbishment projects. 

BREEAM is an example of life cycle assessment, which covers all stages in the life of a construction project, including the transportation of goods, the extraction and manufacture of raw building materials, demolition of the building, and how much of the building is reused or repurposed. 

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) 
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is an environmental certification scheme, developed by the US Green Building Council. It offers a set of rating systems covering the design, construction, operation and maintenance of green buildings, homes and neighbourhoods, and provides third-party verification that a project meets high standards of sustainability. It aims to help building owners and operators be environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently. 
LEED-certified buildings are healthier, more productive places that reduce stress on the environment. They are energy and resource efficient, and enjoy increased building value and decreased utility costs. 


Timber Research and Development Association (TRADA) 
The Timber Research and Development Association (TRADA) is an international membership organisation dedicated to inspiring and informing best practice design, specification and use of wood in the built environment and related fields. 
It has a comprehensive online library, which is free to access for its members. Among its resources are wood information sheets, case studies and technical guidance relating to healthy buildings. 
TRADA also provides training and events throughout the country to educate designers and engineers. 



WELL Building Standard 
The WELL Building Standard measures, certifies and monitors aspects of the built environment that affect human health and wellbeing. It looks at seven different factors: 
• 
Air: achieve optimum air quality by preventing and removing contaminants and purifying the air. 

• 
Water: achieve optimum water quality by using filtration and treatment, and ensure water is accessible by placing water points in optimum positions. 

• 
Nourishment: ensure the availability of and access to healthier food choices, and encourage better eating habits by providing information to users of the building. 

• 
Light: ensure lighting levels are appropriate for the tasks carried out in the building through the design of windows and lighting. 

• 
Fitness: provide opportunities for physical activity for users of the building, to maintain a fitness regime. 

• 
Comfort: create a soothing and comforting environment, for example by ensuring that thermal and acoustic parameters that might cause discomfort can be controlled. 

• 
Mind: support mental and emotional health by providing building users with relaxation spaces and knowledge about their environment. 


1.3 Retrofitting to improve energy efficiency 
PAS 2035:2019 
To ensure the UK can meet its obligations under the Climate Change Act 2008, the energy efficiency of all its existing building stock needs to be improved. 
PAS 2035 provides a specification and best practice guidance on retrofitting dwellings (domestic buildings) for improved energy efficiency. It covers how to: 
• 
assess dwellings for retrofit 

• 
identify and evaluate improvement options 

• 
design and specify energy efficiency measures (EEMs) 

• 
monitor and evaluate retrofit projects. 



The standard requires a whole-house approach. This involves identifying and installing all energy-saving interventions at the same time, to ensure they interact in such a way as to optimise energy efficiency. 
PAS 2035 also specifies five new retrofit roles: 
• 
Retrofit assessors undertake retrofit assessments for dwellings in accordance with PAS 2035. 

• 
Retrofit co-ordinators provide a project management role. 

• 
Retrofit advisors provide advice to clients and homeowners on the retrofit process. 

• 
Retrofit designers prepare a safe and effective retrofit design. 

• 
Retrofit evaluators monitor the impact of installed EEMs to ensure they meet the intended outcomes. 


PAS 2038:2021 
This specification sets out requirements for retrofitting non-domestic buildings for improved energy efficiency. It covers all buildings except those used as private dwellings, including multi-residential buildings in which occupants share some communal facilities (for example hotels and student accommodation). 
The PAS defines technically robust and responsible whole-building retrofit processes that support: 
‘improved functionality, usability and durability of buildings 
improved comfort, wellbeing, health and safety (including fire safety) and productivity of building occupants and visitors 
enabling buildings to use low- or zero-carbon energy supplies 
improved energy efficiency, leading to reduced fuel use, fuel costs and pollution (especially greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy use) 
reduced environmental impacts of buildings 
protection and enhancement of the architectural and cultural heritage as represented by the building stock 
avoidance of unintended consequences related to any of the above, and 
minimisation of the ‘performance gap’ that occurs when reductions in fuel use, fuel cost and carbon dioxide emissions are not as large as intended or predicted.’ 
Source: PAS 2038:2021 



Sustainability involves a commitment to environmental, economic and social objectives: 
• 
Environmental sustainability is about acting responsibly to avoid the depletion of or damage to natural resources. It involves protecting the environment from the impact of emissions, sewage and waste. 

• 
Economic sustainability is about supporting long­term economic growth and ensuring profitability. It involves making more efficient use of resources such as labour, materials, energy and water. 

• 
Social sustainability focuses on wellbeing and quality of life. It involves recognising the needs of everyone impacted by construction projects, from design to demolition. This includes construction workers, local communities, project supply chains and users of the building. 


Sustainable construction is guided by these objectives during all stages of a project. 
2.1Sustainable solutions 
Prefabricated construction 
Prefabricated construction combines pre-engineered units to form major elements of a building. They are manufactured in factories and then transported to site where they are assembled. 
Benefits of prefabricated construction include: 
• 
reduced waste (a huge environmental benefit) 

• 
lower build costs 

• 
design and build flexibility 

• 
consistent accuracy and quality of components 

• 
reduced construction time. 


See Chapter 3, section 2.1 and Chapter 7, section 1.2 for more details. 
Self-healing concrete 
Self-healing concrete contains the spores of limestone­producing bacteria and a food source. When cracks occur, moisture in the air causes the spores to germinate. The reactivated bacteria then eat the food source and excrete calcite to heal the crack. 
Green roofs 
A green roof, also known as a living roof, is an attractive and sustainable roof system that involves installing additional waterproof membranes and drainage mediums, onto which soil is added to allow growth of vegetation. 
The benefits of green roofs include: 
• 
reduction of water run-off from roof areas 

• 
extended roof life 

• 
insulation of the building (keeping it warm in winter and cool in summer) 

• 
sound insulation 

• 
providing a habitat for wildlife. 



. Figure 5.2 Green roof 
Smart glass 
Smart glass (also known as switchable glass) changes from transparent to translucent (and vice versa) when exposed to specific levels of voltage, heat or light. 
Benefits of smart glass include: 
• 
reduced energy costs 

• 
increased privacy 

• 
controlled room temperatures 

• 
improved security.

. Figure 5.3 Smart glass 
Grey water 
Grey water refers to waste water generated from hand basins, washing machines, showers and baths. Rather than sending it down the drain, it can be reused for watering plants and flushing toilets. 
For more information on grey water, see section 10 of this chapter. 
Reed beds 
Reed beds are artificially constructed wetlands that use natural filtration and biological processes to break down organic matter in waste water and sewage effluent. 
There are two different types: 
• 
horizontal flow 

• 
vertical flow. 



Soakaways 
Soakaways are an effective way of dealing with surface water. They are essentially large underground holes, filled with coarse stones or purpose-made plastic crates, which allow water to filter through and soak into the ground. 
Smart cement 
Smart cement contains potassium ions, which allow it to store electricity for long periods of time. If a building was constructed using this cement, and connected to a power source such as photovoltaic panels, it could store power during the day and release it at night. 


3.1Environmental Protection Act 1990 
The Environmental Protection Act 1990 defines legal responsibilities for the management of waste and pollution, and places a duty on local authorities for collecting waste. Under this legislation, businesses have a duty to handle waste safely. 
3.2 Climate Change Act 2008 
The Climate Change Act 2008 set a target for the UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. This target was updated in 2019 to 100 per cent – net zero. 
The main elements of the act are: 
• 
setting emissions reduction targets and carbon budgeting 

• 
establishing a system for annual government reporting on emissions 

• 
creating an independent advisory body (the Committee on Climate Change) 



• 
giving powers to enable the government to introduce trading schemes to lower emissions 

• 
providing a procedure for assessing the risks of climate change 

• 
requiring the government to develop an adaptation programme for sustainable development 

• 
supporting emissions reductions through various policy measures, such as amendments to improve renewable transport fuel obligations, powers to introduce charges for single-use plastic bags and powers to trial incentive schemes for household waste minimisation and recycling. 


3.3 Clean Air Act 1993 
The Clean Air Act was first enacted in 1956, in response to the Great Smog of London of 1952 – a dense yellow smog that descended on London and contributed to an estimated 4,000 deaths. It was modified by the Clean Air Act 1968, and repealed by the Clean Air Act 1993. 
The act covers a range of topics, including: 
• 
prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys 

• 
prohibition of dark smoke from industrial or trade premises 

• 
the requirement for new furnaces to be smokeless (so far as is reasonably practicable) 

• 
the emission of grit and dust from furnaces 

• 
the height of chimneys for furnaces 

• 
declarations of smoke control areas by local authorities. 


Under this legislation, local authorities may declare the whole or part of the district of the authority to be a smoke control area, where it is an offence to emit smoke from the chimney of any building, furnace or fixed boiler. 

. Figure 5.4 It is an offence to emit smoke in a smoke control area 

3.4 Water Act 2014 
The main aims of the Water Act 2014 were to: 
• 
reform the water industry to make it more innovative and responsive to customers 

• 
increase the resilience of water supplies to natural hazards such as droughts and floods 


• address the availability and affordability of insurance for households at high risk of flooding. Source: www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015­government-policy-water-industry 
It includes information on topics such as: 
• the water industry: 
– 
water supply licences and sewerage licences 

– 
water undertakers and sewerage undertakers 

– 
regulation of the water industry 


• water resources: 
– 
water abstraction reform 

– 
main rivers in England and Wales 

– 
maps of waterworks 


• 
environmental regulation 

•

– 
flood insurance obligations. 





3.5 Building Regulations 2010 
Nearly all new construction work and alterations to existing structures have to comply with the Building Regulations 2010. The requirements are set out in Schedule 1 and cover a range of topics: 
• 
Part A: Structure 

• 
Part B: Fire safety 

• 
Part C: Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture 

• 
Part D: Toxic substances 

• 
Part E: Resistance to the passage of sound 

• 
Part F: Ventilation 

• 
Part G: Sanitation, hot water safety and water efficiency 

• 
Part H: Drainage and waste disposal 

• 
Part J: Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems 

• 
Part K: Protection from falling, collision and impact 

• 
Part L: Conservation of fuel and power 

• 
Part M: Access to and use of buildings 

• 
Part N: Glazing – safety in relation to impact, opening and cleaning 

• 
Part O: Overheating 

• 
Part P: Electrical safety 

• 
Part Q: Security in dwellings 

• 
Part R: Infrastructure for high-speed electronic communications networks 

• 
Part S: Infrastructure for the charging of electric vehicles. 


To help people comply with the regulations, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government publishes approved documents that offer general guidance on each part of the law (more on these in Chapter 7, section 3.1). 
Sustainability is a common theme throughout the approved documents. For example, Approved Document G states that water consumption in a new building should not be greater than 125 litres per person per day. Approved Document L sets minimum appliance efficiencies and control requirements for gas, oil and solid-fuel heating equipment. 
The Domestic Building Services Compliance Guide supports Approved Document L and provides guidance for the installation of fixed building services in new and existing dwellings to help compliance with the energy-efficiency requirements of the Building Regulations. 
The Domestic Ventilation Compliance Guide supports Approved Document F. It helps architects, planners and installers to comply with the Building Regulations by ensuring the provision of adequate ventilation while minimising energy use and environmental issues. 
3.6 Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002 
The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002 are intended to protect people from ill health caused by exposure to hazardous substances. Details of the COSHH regulations can be found in Chapter 1. 
Manufacturers and suppliers of hazardous substances produce safety data sheets that contain important information about how products should be transported, used, stored and safely disposed of after use, any special conditions you should be aware of and how to deal with the substance in an emergency. 
The COSHH Regulations detail measures that must be taken to ensure substances do not pose a hazard to the environment, for example chemicals being discharged or leaked into water sources. 

The Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 restrict the production, movement, receiving and disposal of hazardous waste, such as fluorescent tubes, refrigerators and asbestos. They introduced a registration process for producers of hazardous waste and a new system for controlling, tracking and recording the movement of hazardous waste. 

3.8 Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001 
Also known as the Oil Storage Regulations or simply OSR, these regulations were designed to reduce incidents of oil escaping into the environment. They require anyone in England who stores more than 200 litres of oil to provide a more secure containment facility for tanks, drums, bulk containers and mobile bowsers. 


All types of oil are covered by the regulations, except for waste mineral oil. 
3.7 Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 
Under environmental legislation, waste is considered hazardous if it contains substances or has properties that might make it harmful to either human health or the environment. 


3.9Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 
The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is an EU legislative instrument that aims to reduce the carbon emissions produced by buildings. It requires: 
• 
the production of an energy performance certificate whenever a building is sold, rented out or constructed 

• 
the production of a display energy certificate for large public buildings, which must be displayed in a prominent place 

• 
the regular inspection of air-conditioning systems and boilers. 


The requirements of the directive were implemented on a phased basis by the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007. Later, the Energy Performance (England and Wales) Regulations 2012 consolidated and revoked all previous regulations. 


4.1Performance measures 
Environmental performance can be measured by looking at a range of factors during the design, construction, use and demolition of a building. 
Source and use of materials 
Sourcing materials locally has a lower environmental impact, as it uses less transportation and therefore causes fewer carbon emissions. 

When choosing materials to construct a building, it is also important to consider their: 
• 
recyclability 

• 
maintenance requirements 

• 
thermal properties. 



. Figure 5.7 Using locally sourced materials will cause fewer carbon emissions 
Energy source and consumption 
The energy efficiency of a building depends on its use, design, orientation, location and the materials used in its construction. 
Choosing a form of heating that is based on renewable energy, such as ground or air source heat pumps, will improve a building’s environmental performance. Similarly, environmentally friendly electrical systems can generate power using solar panels or wind turbines. 
It is also important to ensure a thermally efficient building, that reduces heat losses/gains and so requires minimal heating and cooling. Materials with a lower U-value lose less heat and are more efficient. 
Maximising daylight in a building can help to reduce lighting costs, as well as energy consumption due to solar heat gain. 

Water source and usage 
In order to improve a building’s environmental impact, it is important to minimise water usage. This can be achieved by installing: 
• 
grey-water recycling systems 

• 
rainwater harvesting systems 

• 
flow-limiting valves 

• 
dual-flush toilets 

• 
water-saving showers 

• 
infrared taps. 


Flexibility 
The more easily a change of use can be accommodated by a building, the better its sustainability. A building should therefore be designed to allow adaptation, conversion and extension in the future, for example using building components that can be easily disassembled and repositioned for flexibility. 
Adapting an established structure for a new purpose can support sustainability, since a substantial part of the existing building fabric will be reused. Depending on the repurposed design, fewer new materials will be required, which translates into less energy being consumed during manufacture. It also avoids the negative impact of demolition on the environment. 
Durability and resilience 
The environmental impact of a building depends on its: 
• 
resistance to degradation over time (durability) 

• 
ability to adapt and respond to changing conditions while maintaining functionality (resilience). 


A durable and resilient building will have a lower environmental impact as it will require less maintenance and repair throughout its life cycle. 
Pollution and waste processing 
Construction that generates large amounts of waste or causes pollution to land, air or water will have a negative environmental impact. It is important to design waste out of all the stages of a building’s life cycle, from construction to use to demolition. 
For example, waste can be reduced by: 
• 
using standardised components (for example bricks and blocks) 

• 
storing materials carefully to avoid damage or deterioration (for example cement or lengths of timber) 

• 
recycling, reusing and repurposing materials (for example demolition materials) 



• installing energy-efficient and non-polluting systems (for example heating systems). 
Transport 
Transporting construction materials over long distances will have a negative effect on the environment due to vehicle emissions. Therefore, buildings that use locally sourced materials are considered more sustainable. 
Buildings that are easily accessible using local public transport systems will have a lower impact on the environment than those that are only accessible by car. 
Demolition 
Well-planned management of demolition means that building materials used during construction can be recycled, thereby reducing environmental impact. The more of a building that can be recycled, the better. For example: 
• 
Concrete can be broken down as aggregate. 

• 
Drywall’s paper covering can be recycled like most paper products, and the gypsum core is ideal for recycling as garden fertiliser. 

• 
Glass can either be recycled into new glass or broken down as aggregate. 

• 
Steel can easily be melted down and recycled. 


4.2Schemes 
Several schemes can be used to certify levels of environmental performance in construction, for example: 
• 
Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) (see section 1.2 of this chapter) 

• 
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) (see section 1.2 of this chapter) 

• 
Passivhaus. 




5.1 Listed buildings 
There are three types of listed status for buildings in England and Wales: 
• 
Grade I – buildings of exceptional interest 

• 
Grade II* – particularly important buildings of more than special interest 

• 
Grade II – buildings of special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them. 


Buildings are listed in their entirety, even though some parts may be more important than others. The designation regime is set out in the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. 
The government document Principles of Selection for Listed Buildings sets out the criteria that the Secretary of State applies when assessing whether a building is of special architectural or historic interest: 
• 
To be of special architectural interest, a building must be of importance in its architectural design, decoration or craftsmanship. 

• 
To be of special historic interest, a building must illustrate important aspects of the nation’s social, economic, cultural or military history. 


Listed building consent is required for all works of demolition, alteration or extension to a listed building that affect its character. This is to ensure the impact of any proposed changes is reviewed before they are approved. This is usually carried out by a conservation officer within the local authority planning department. 
Local planning authorities may serve a building preservation notice (BPN) on the owner and occupier of a building which is not listed, but which they consider is of special architectural or historic interest and which is in danger of demolition or of alteration in such a way as to affect its character. 
When carrying out work on listed buildings, it is important that you do not use modern repair methods on traditional construction. For example: 
• 
Using cement on older buildings made from materials such as lime mortar can cause irreparable damage. 

• 
Traditional cast-iron soil stacks should be replaced like for like, and not substituted with modern plastic pipework. 



• Any original architectural features such as doors, decorative stonework, fireplaces or windows should not be altered. 
Any changes and the materials used must be agreed with the conservation officer. 
On a listed building, you cannot paint or render stonework, demolish chimney stacks, or add new pipework, flues or alarm boxes on principal elevations of the property. 

The Heritage Protection Bill is a legislative and policy framework which protects the historic environment. It requires consents and permissions to protect England’s heritage via a balanced, democratic and informed approach to managing changes in historic places. The different heritage assets are protected in different ways and various consents are required when carrying out works to existing buildings and for new development. 
5.2Conservation areas 
Local planning authorities have the power to designate any area of special architectural or historic interest as a conservation area, where the character or appearance should be preserved. The special character of these areas is not just made up of buildings but can also be defined by features which contribute to particular scenic views, such as woodland or open spaces. 
5.3 Town and Country Planning Act 1990 
Under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, planning permission needs to be sought when carrying out work to: 
• 
build a new property 

• 
increase the size of an existing property 

• 
make significant alterations to an existing property 

• 
change the use of an existing property. 


The process of applying for planning permission is straightforward and completed with the local authority planning department.

6.1Principles 
Lean construction is a construction methodology that aims to minimise waste in terms of costs, materials, time and effort, while maximising productivity and value. 
The principles of lean construction are: 
• 
efficiency 

• 
best value 

• 
ensuring the work environment is clean and safe 

• 
improving planning 

• 
continuous review and improvement. 


6.2Techniques 
A common example of a lean construction technique is just-in-time deliveries. This is a method of providing the required materials for a project in precisely the correct order and quantity at exactly the right time for installation. 
The benefits of just-in-time deliveries include: 
• 
elimination of waste 

• 
less storage space needed 

• 
a stabilised work schedule 

• 
reduction in the cost of inventories and inventory requirements. 


Another example of a lean construction technique is artificial intelligence (AI). In the construction sector, AI is commonly used to develop safety systems for construction worksites. This includes tracking the interactions of tasks, workers, machinery and objects on a construction site and alerting supervisors to potential safety issues, construction errors and productivity issues, thereby reducing errors and health and safety risks during the construction of buildings. 
Recycling is another commonly used method of lean construction. Recycling materials reduces the requirements for the use of new raw materials during the construction stage, eliminating waste removal from site and avoiding over ordering of materials, which can result in additional waste and an increase in the carbon footprint of the building.

6.3 Advanced manufacturing 
The manufacturing industry is constantly evolving. Increased use of digitalisation has resulted in processes that are more efficient, effective and responsive and rely less on human effort. 
Computer numerical control (CNC) is used in manufacturing as a method for controlling machine tools using software. It allows data produced in CAD programmes to control automated operations, such as milling, lathing, routing and grinding. This results in rapid, accurate and repeatable machining of bespoke components. 

. Figure 5.9 CNC machining 
While the construction industry is always likely to rely predominantly on physical labour performed by human workers, with many different trades and disciplines working simultaneously on site, the development of manufacturing robots can automate repetitive tasks, to increase production rates and efficiency, ensure greater accuracy and protect workers from hazards. 
• Robots are used in factories to produce pre­engineered units for modular construction. These are then transported to site for assembly by human workers. This assembly-line method of producing major elements of a building is much more efficient than traditional processes. 

• 
3D-printing robots build components in three dimensions by extruding layers of material in a sequence specified by software. In construction, they have been used to produce individual bespoke items such as decorative cladding panels and some structural components. Huge experimental machines with robotic arms have even been designed to create entire buildings using specialist concrete with fibre additives. 

• 
Bricklaying robots have been invented that read from construction drawings and lay bricks and mortar around a track. However, human input is still required for tasks such as pointing and installing damp-proof courses. 

• 
Demolition robots can be used where risks to personnel are considered too high, for example when dismantling unstable or fragile structures. 


For more information, see Chapter 7. 


7.1 Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2013 
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2013 implemented in UK law the provisions of the EU WEEE Directive. They aim to support sustainable production and consumption through the collection, reuse, recycling, recovery and treatment of end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). This both reduces the need to produce new equipment and minimises the amount of waste sent to landfill, reducing associated environmental impacts. 
The WEEE Regulations cover the categories of appliance shown in Table 5.1. 
. Table 5.1 Examples of appliances covered by the WEEE Regulations 
Type of appliance  Examples  
Large household appliances  Refrigerators, cookers, microwaves, washing machines, dishwashers, air conditioners  
Small household appliances  Vacuum cleaners, irons, toasters, clocks, kettles, fryers, electric knives, body care appliances  
IT and telecommunications equipment  Personal computers, copying equipment, telephones, pocket calculators, screens, printers  
Consumer equipment and photovoltaic panels  Radios, televisions, hi-fi equipment, camcorders, musical instruments, photovoltaic panels, radios  
Lighting equipment  Straight and compact fluorescent tubes, high-intensity discharge lamps  
Electrical and electronic tools  Drills, saws, sewing machines, electric lawnmowers, jigsaws and other gardening equipment  
Toys, leisure and sports equipment  Electric trains, games consoles, running machines  
Medical devices  (Non-infected) dialysis machines, analysers, medical freezers, cardiology equipment  
Monitoring and control instruments  Smoke detectors, thermostats, heating regulators, heating controls, alarm components  
Automatic dispensers  Hot drinks dispensers, money dispensers, snack dispensers  

Under the regulations, producers of EEE have obligations with regards to: 
• 
the EEE they sell 

• 
financing the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE. 


There are specific obligations on producers of non­household equipment when it is discarded as waste by non-household end users. In practice, this means that electrical tools used in construction by contractors must be disposed of in the correct way. 
The regulations also require producers to prioritise, where appropriate, the reuse of whole appliances. 
Regulations state that if you are a large producer (i.e. have more than 5 tonnes of EEE on the market), you must join a producer compliance scheme (PCS). The PCS takes on your obligations to finance the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of household WEEE collected in the UK. 
Distributors of EEE also have specific responsibilities. They must offer to take back waste of the same (or similar) type as the item a customer is purchasing from them, regardless of the method of purchase (in store, online or via mail order) and irrespective of the brand of the item. 
They can discharge these take-back obligations by: 
• 
joining the Distributor Takeback Scheme (DTS) • offering in-store take-back 

• 
providing an alternative free take-back service. 




7.2 Waste carrier licences 
Under section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, there is a duty of care to ensure that waste is managed and disposed of properly. 
If a business transports waste, either for itself or for someone else, it needs to register with the Environment Agency as a waste carrier. If a business’ waste is being collected by someone else, it must ensure that the carrier is registered. 
There are two types of licence, depending on the type of waste to be transported: 
• 
An upper-tier waste carrier transports other people’s waste on a professional basis (for example a waste management company) or its own construction or demolition waste (for example a builder). 

• 
A lower-tier waste carrier was either previously exempt from registration or carries its own (non­construction/non-demolition) waste on a regular and normal basis. This might include carpet fitters taking away offcuts, businesses carrying waste from maintenance work or businesses collecting confidential waste from different locations and transporting it to a centralised office. 



. Figure 5.10 Waste carriers 
7.3 The Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations (2018) 
Fluorinated greenhouse gases (known as F-gases) are synthetic and originate from human activities. The most common type is hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in applications such as refrigeration, air conditioning, fire extinguishers and aerosols. 
While these gases are ozone friendly, and therefore often used in place of ozone-depleting substances, they have a high global warming potential (GWP) and therefore require regulation. 
Under the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations: 
• 
the installation, leak testing, maintenance, repair and disposal of equipment containing F-gases must be performed by trained and certified personnel 

• 
equipment containing F-gases must be tested regularly to check for leaks and any leaks must be repaired as soon as possible 

• 
equipment containing F-gases must be clearly labelled with the type and quantity of the gas (refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment should have an information plate affixed to it) 

• 
records must be kept of: 


– 
types and quantities of gases in use 

– 
leaks detected and repairs carried out 

– 
maintenance history of equipment, including details of the maintenance company or operatives 


• F-gases must be recovered at the end of equipment life and managed appropriately. 



The waste hierarchy sets out the order in which actions 
should be taken to manage waste, from the most to 
least preferable in terms of environmental impact. 
There are five actions: 
1 Reduce: this is about producing less waste and can be achieved by using fewer materials during design and manufacture, keeping products for longer, choosing products with less packaging and using fewer hazardous materials. 
2 Reuse: this involves either using a product multiple times, rather than single use, or repurposing products or their parts at the end of their life by checking, cleaning, repairing or refurbishing them. 
3 Recycle: this involves turning waste into new substances or products and, if it meets quality protocols, composting the material. 
4 Recover: by using the waste products as fuel to provide heat and power; other methods include anaerobic digestion. 
5 Landfill: this is the last resort and involves disposal and incineration without energy recovery. 

Most preferred method 
Least preferred method

8.1Site waste management plans 
While no longer a legal requirement, a site waste management plan (SWMP) is an important document for setting out how waste will be managed and disposed of during a construction project. It should be compiled by the design team, contractor and subcontractors and materials. This ensures compliance with environment legislation, improves resource efficiency and increases profitability. 
Further information on the requirements for working  refer to the waste hierarchy to reduce the volume of  
with F-gases can be found by searching on www.gov.uk.  waste to landfill and increase the use of sustainable  
160  

A typical SWMP should contain information on: 
• 
who has overall responsibility for the management of waste on site 

• 
which contractors will be involved in the waste management process and in what capacity 

• 
which types of waste will be generated, including hazardous waste 

• 
the expected quantity of waste that will be produced 

• 
how waste will be managed both on site and off site. 


Managing waste responsibly can contribute to an improved business reputation, leading to future contracts. 
8.2 Waste segregation 
Waste segregation means dividing waste into different categories for efficient disposal. Not only does this support the waste hierarchy and protect the environment, by offering opportunities to reuse and recycle waste before resorting to landfill, but it also offers cost savings to construction businesses. Sorted waste is cheaper to dispose of, and some types of waste can even be sold as a source of income. 
Hazardous waste in particular should be segregated and disposed of carefully, due to the risk of harm to human health and the environment. There are specific regulations that cover this, namely the Hazardous Waste Regulations 2005 (see section 3.7 in this chapter). 
Waste on a construction site is usually segregated into the following streams: 
• 
general (for example insulating materials that do not contain asbestos) 

• 
hazardous (for example asbestos) 

• 
clean fill (material that can be recycled or reused in future construction projects) 

• 
hard fill (for example soil, concrete, bricks and blocks) 

• 
plastic 

• 
metal 

• 
wood. 


It is important that all staff on a construction site are trained on the site’s waste policy and the waste hierarchy, to ensure waste segregation is maximised. 
8.3Recycling 
Prior to the adoption of environmentally friendly methods of managing waste, such as recycling, reusing and repurposing, most waste was disposed of by burying it in landfill sites or burning it at extremely high temperatures (incineration), depending on the type of material. Some waste is still disposed of in this way. 

Recycling or reusing materials can reduce the overall carbon emissions that are produced during manufacturing. 
Metals 
Often, a building may appear to consist mostly of masonry or concrete. However, surprising quantities of different metals may be present in the structure. Scrap or waste metal can be recovered and reprocessed into new products, for example: 
• 
structural steel columns, beams and lintels 

• 
pipework made from lead (in older buildings) or copper 

• 
cables with copper or aluminium cores. 


Metal to be recycled is usually separated into ferrous (containing iron) and non-ferrous before collection. 
Plastic 
Plastic waste can be very harmful to the environment. When it is disposed of in landfill, it can take hundreds of years to break down, and if it ends up in our oceans, it can damage ecosystems and kill marine life. 
It is therefore important to segregate and recycle as much plastic waste as possible. Waste plastic can be reprocessed into many different products, from drinks bottles to car components to building materials. 
Timber 
Offcuts of timber can be reprocessed into new resources, such as: 
• 
chipboard and medium density fibreboard (MDF) 

• 
paper and cardboard 

• 
mulch 

• 
bedding for animals 

• 
biomass fuel. 


Bricks and blocks 
Undamaged bricks and blocks can easily be reused in new building projects. Brick and block waste from cutting operations can be crushed and used as aggregate in some types of concrete. 


9.1Energy production 
In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered that electricity could be generated by moving a bar magnet through a wire coil. This is the principle upon which modern generators work. 
In a power station generator, a huge magnet is mounted on a central rotating shaft; this is known as the rotor. Around the rotor is a series of coils known as the stator, which is where the electricity is generated by the rotating magnetic field. As the rotor and stator may weigh several hundred tons, an energy source is required to turn the rotor, for example a turbine. 
In the UK, electricity is generated in several different ways, for example by: 
• 
burning fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil 

• 
using nuclear fission 

• 
using renewable energy, such as wind, wave, hydro, biomass and solar. 


Most power stations are steam powered. The heat created by burning fossil fuels or through nuclear fission is used to produce superheated steam to drive a turbine. This causes the rotor to turn, creating an alternator as in Faraday’s prototype. The rotor turns at 3,000 revolutions per minute (50 revolutions per second) and produces an alternating current (AC) with a frequency of 50 hertz (cycles per second). The electromotive force causes current to flow. 
FOSSIL FUELS Coal Oil Gas Nuclear 


. Figure 5.12 How electricity is produced 

See Chapter 2, section 5, for more information on electricity generation and transmission. 

Non-renewable energy sources 
Fossil fuel is a term used to describe an energy source formed by the decomposition of organic matter beneath the Earth’s surface over millions of years: 
• 
coal is formed from dead trees and plants 

• 
crude oil and gas are formed from dead marine plants and animals. 


Fossil fuels are predominantly composed of carbon and hydrogen. They are burned in power stations to heat water and provide steam for turbines. However, this process releases carbon dioxide, which can contribute to the greenhouse effect and climate change. 
Fossil fuels are a finite resource, which means that they are being used up faster than they can be replaced. 
Nuclear power plants use reactors to split atoms, causing a large amount of thermal energy to be released. This process is called nuclear fission. Uranium is the main fuel for nuclear reactors. 
• 
Nuclear reactions generate thermal energy. 

• 
Thermal energy generates water vapour (steam). 

• 
Steam powers a turbine, producing mechanical energy (kinetic energy). 

• 
Mechanical energy actuates an electrical generator, producing electricity. 


. Table 5.2 Advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power 

• 
Does not produce polluting gases 

• 
Does not contribute to global warming 

• 
Low fuel cost 

• 
Low fuel quantity required 

• 
Power station has a long life 

• 
Costs are high for building and decommissioning 

• 
Waste is radioactive 

• 
Accidents can be catastrophic 


Renewable energy sources 
Renewable energy sources are obtained from the environment around us and are naturally replenished. As the availability of non-renewable energy diminishes and the effects of global warming intensify, it is important that society considers the use of these technologies as alternatives. 


Bioenergy 
Bioenergy is created using biomass – organic material such as wood, plants, agricultural crops, food waste or even sewage. 
Biomass can be burned in power stations to heat water and produce high-pressure steam. The steam flows over turbine blades, causing them to rotate, which in turn drives a generator and produces electricity. 
Biomass can also be converted into liquid fuels, for example biodiesel for use in vehicles. 

Wind energy 
The natural kinetic energy of the wind can be used to drive an aerodynamic bladed turbine, rotating a generator and producing electricity. Often many wind turbines are grouped together to form a wind farm and provide bulk power to the National Grid. 
Turbines can be installed on land or offshore where there is a reliable source of wind. 

. Figure 5.13 How wind turbines generate electricity 



Solar energy 
Solar energy utilises photovoltaic (PV) panels to convert the sun’s radiation into electricity. The panels can be installed on the roofs of buildings or in larger­scale solar farms. Solar farms are capable of delivering bulk power to the National Grid. 
In order to maximise the energy generated by PV panels, is it important to install them carefully, for example where there is enough sunlight and facing in an appropriate direction. 

Hydroelectric energy 
Hydroelectric power plants produce energy by channelling running water through a turbine connected to an electrical generator. The electricity is then fed into the National Grid for distribution. 
They can use the natural flow of a river as it falls from a greater to a lesser height, or artificial reservoirs and dams, which hold back water and release it as required. 

. Figure 5.14 Generating electricity through hydroelectric power 


Wave and tidal energy 
Energy from the movement of waves and tidal flows can be used to generate electricity. Wave and tidal generators are similar to wind generators, except that they use the ocean’s current to rotate the turbine instead of wind. This type of energy production is ever-changing, with a wide range of options available to harness the power of waves and tides. These options include absorbers, attenuators, water columns and pendulum devices. 
The amount of energy created is determined by the wave’s height, speed, wavelength and water density. Wave power is much more predictable than wind 

9.2 Energy use 
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) publishes an annual statistical publication titled ‘Energy Consumption in the United Kingdom’ (ECUK). This collates data from a variety of sources to provide a comprehensive review of UK energy consumption and changes in intensity and output since the 1970s. 

Energy consumption is reported annually for the following sectors: 
• 
domestic 

• 
transport 

• 
industry 

•

10.1 Uses of renewable energy sources 
As mentioned earlier, renewable energy sources are naturally replenished, such as solar, wind, tidal and geothermal. They can be used in a wide range of applications, from small-scale systems such as solar thermal providing hot water for one property to large­scale wind farms producing energy for national use. 
Non-renewable energy sources are finite and cannot be replenished as quickly as they are used, for example coal, oil and gas. 
Energy sources fall into one of three categories according to their level of carbon emissions: high carbon, low carbon and zero carbon. 
. Table 5.3 Energy sources categorised according to their carbon emissions 
Category  Energy sources  
High carbon  • Coal • Oil • Natural gas • Liquified petroleum gas (LPG)  
Low carbon  • Solar thermal • Biomass • Heat pumps • Combined heat and power (CHP) • Combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) • Hydrogen fuel cells  
Zero carbon  • Wind • Wave/tidal • Hydroelectric • Solar photovoltaic • Nuclear  



Solar thermal 
Solar thermal systems use either a roof-mounted or ground-mounted collector to harness the sun’s energy and heat domestic water. A conventional boiler or immersion heater (auxiliary heat source) is used to top up the water temperature to 60°C. 
Solar collector 


Cold water in pump 

. Figure 5.17 Solar thermal system components 
Key components of a solar thermal system are as follows: 
• 
A solar collector absorbs heat radiation from the sun. There are two types: 

– 
a flat plate collector, consisting of a series of flat glass or plastic pipes with a black metal surface, used to absorb the heat 

– 
an evacuated tube collector, consisting of a set of tubes connected to a header, used to absorb the heat and transfer it to the water contained within it. 



• 
A differential temperature controller (DTC) has sensors connected to the solar collector and the hot water cylinder. Its purpose is to monitor the temperature at both points of the system and switch the circulating pump on and off. 

• 
A circulating pump is controlled by the DTC and circulates the system’s heat transfer liquid around the solar hot water circuit. 

• 
A hot water storage cylinder enables the transfer of heat from the solar collector circuit to the stored water for use at terminal fittings. 

• 
An auxiliary heat source is used to provide hot water when solar energy is unavailable. 




Ground source to water heat pump with horizontalclosed-loop collector 
. Table 5.4 Advantages and disadvantages of solar thermal systems 

• 
Reduced carbon emissions 

• 
Lower energy costs 

• 
Low maintenance 

• 
Improved energy performance certificate rating 

• 
Not compatible with all existing hot water systems 

• 
Less solar energy available in the winter months 

• 
High initial installation costs 

• 
Require an auxiliary heat source 



Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) 
Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) extract heat from the ground using a system of underground pipes filled with a mixture of water and antifreeze known as glycol. A heat exchanger then transfers the heat to the pump itself, ready for distribution to: 
• 
warm-air heating systems (ground to air pumps) 

• 
underfloor heating systems, radiators and hot water cylinders (ground to water pumps). 

Key components of a GSHP include: 

• 
a heat collection ground loop, set out in one of two arrays: 


– 
a horizontal array has flattened, overlapping coils known as slinkies that are spread out in shallow trenches about 1.5–2 m deep 

– 
a vertical array has pipes installed in holes bored to a depth of 15–60 m, depending on soil conditions 


• 
a circulating pump, which circulates a mixture of water and antifreeze around the pipes 

• 
a heat pump, which extracts heat from the ground and transfers it for domestic use by means of an electric compressor 

• 
a heating system, which is used to heat the property. 





Air source heat pumps (ASHPs) 
Air source heat pumps (ASHPs) extract heat from outside air. Using a heat exchanger, compressor and expansion valve, they distribute the heat to: 
• 
warm-air convectors (air to air pumps, usually used in commercial buildings as a reverse cycle heat pump that can be used for both heating and cooling) 

• 
underfloor heating systems, radiators, hot water cylinders and even swimming pools (air to water pumps). 


ASHPs can get heat from the air even when the temperature is as low as –15°C. 

. Figure 5.20 Air source heat pump 
Water source heat pumps (WSHPs) 
Water source heat pumps (WSHPs) operate in a similar way to GSHPs, with the collector located in a body of water (such as a lake) to extract heat. 
Heat pumps are not able to provide instant heat, so they work better when they run continuously. Start­stop operations will shorten their lifespan. A buffer tank is incorporated into the system so that when heat is not required, the heat pump can ‘dump’ the heat into the vessel and keep running. When heat is needed, it can be drawn from the buffer tank. 




Biomass 
Biomass is plant or animal material that can be burned to create heat. Unlike fossil fuels, which have taken millions of years to form, biomass material has been sourced recently. 
When burned, both fossil fuels and biomass produce carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas linked to global warming. However, biomass material absorbs carbon dioxide as it grows, reducing the amount in the atmosphere, so burning biomass does not lead to a net increase in levels. 
Biomass can be used to heat: 
• 
individual rooms using stoves (these may be fitted with a back boiler to heat water too) 

• 
whole properties, using boilers that supply central heating and hot water systems.

Solar photovoltaics 
As mentioned earlier, solar energy uses photovoltaic (PV) panels to convert the sun’s radiation into electricity. 
PV systems can be divided into two categories: • off-grid systems, where the PV modules are used to charge batteries • on-grid systems, where the PV modules are connected to the National Grid via an inverter.

PV modules are available in different efficiencies: 
• 
Monocrystalline modules range in efficiency from 15 to 20 per cent. 

• 
Polycrystalline modules range in efficiency from 13 to 16 per cent. 

• 
Amorphous film ranges in efficiency from 5 to 7 per cent. 

Photovoltaic modules can be fitted in different ways: 

• 
On-roof systems comprise aluminium rails, which are fixed to the roof structure by means of roof hooks. 

• 
In-roof systems replace roof tiles with the PV modules. 

• 
Ground-mount and pole-mount systems provide free-standing PV arrays, which can also be installed as computer-controlled motorised mounting systems that rotate and track the sun as it moves across the sky. 


An inverter converts the DC input to a 230 V AC 50 Hz output and synchronises it with the frequency of the mains supply. 


• 
The wind passes over the rotor blades of a turbine, causing it to turn. 

• 
The hub is connected by a low-speed shaft to a gearbox. 

• 
The gearbox output is connected to a high-speed shaft that drives a generator which, in turn, produces electricity. 


Turbines are available as either horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) or vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs).

There are two types of micro-wind turbine suitable for domestic installation: 
.
 pole-mounted (free-standing) 

.
 building-mounted (fitted directly to the building, generally smaller than pole-mounted turbines). 


As with solar PV, there are several connection options: 
. off-grid systems charge batteries in order to store electricity for later use 
. on-grid (grid-tied) systems are connected in parallel with the grid supply via an inverter.

Micro-hydro 
Micro-hydro is a type of hydroelectric power that harnesses kinetic energy as water moves from a higher to a lower level. The water passes across or through a turbine, which turns a generator and produces electricity. 
As with the other micro-generation technologies, there are two possible system arrangements for micro-hydro: on-grid and off-grid systems. 
The main components of the water course construction are: 
. intake (the point where some of the river’s water is diverted from the main stream) 

.
 the canal (connecting the intake to the forebay) 

.
 the forebay (a reservoir of water ensuring that the penstock is always pressurised and allowing surges in demand to be catered for) 

.
 the penstock (pipework taking water from the forebay to the turbine) 

.
 the powerhouse (the building housing the turbine and generator) 

.
 the tailrace (the outlet that takes the water exiting the turbine and returns it to the mainstream of the river).

. Figure 5.27 Water course for a micro-hydro system 
To ascertain the suitability of a water source for hydroelectric generation, it is necessary to consider the head (vertical height difference between the proposed inlet position and the proposed outlet) and the amount of water flowing through the water course. 
. Table 5.9 Advantages and disadvantages of micro­hydro systems 
Advantages 
•
 Excellent payback potential 

• 
Zero-carbon technology 

•
 Effective where no mains electricity is available 



Disadvantages 
•
 Require a watercourse with suitable head and flow 

•

Industry tip 
Flow is measured in cubic metres per second (m3/s). 

The boiler system works as follows: 
Micro combined heat and power 
(micro CHP) 
Micro combined heat and power (micro CHP) systems generate useable heat and electricity for properties at the same time. The fuel source is usually natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), but it could also be biomass. 

. Figure 5.28 Micro CHP boiler 
The key components of a micro CHP boiler are the: 
• 
engine burner (1) 

• 
Stirling generator (2) 

• 
supplementary burner (3) 

• 
heat exchanger (4).

• 
When there is a call for heat, the engine burner fires and starts the Stirling generator. The engine burner produces about 25 per cent of the full heat output. The burner preheats the heating-system return water before it passes to the main heat exchanger. 

• 
Hot flue gases from the engine burner are passed across the heat exchanger to heat the heating-system water even more. If there is more demand than supply, the supplementary burner operates. 

• 
The Stirling generator uses the expansion and contraction of internal gas (often helium) to operate the piston. When the engine burner fires, the gas expands, forcing the piston downwards. 

• 
The return water from the heating system passes across the engine, causing the gas to contract. A spring mechanism in the engine returns the piston to the stop, and the process starts again. 


. Table 5.10 Advantages and disadvantages of micro CHP systems 

• 
Domestic units now similar in size to central-heating boilers 

• 
Produce free electricity while generating heat 

• 
Do not rely on building orientation or weather conditions to operate effectively 

• 
More expensive than central-heating boilers 

• 
Not suitable for properties with low heat demand 

• 
Limited electrical generation capacity 

• 
Low-carbon rather than zero-carbon 



Combined heat and power (CHP) 
Combined heat and power (CHP) systems (also known as cogeneration systems) use waste thermal energy from the generation of electricity for district or industrial heating purposes. The heat is produced centrally at one or more locations and supplied to an unrestricted number of residential and industrial customers, using either steam or high-temperature water. 

. Figure 5.30 Combined heat and power system

• 
Not suitable for all sites because of constant and consistent power demands 

• 
Can be expensive: initial cost is high due to the technology and payback periods can be very long 



10.2Energy conservation 
Rainwater harvesting 
Rainwater harvesting involves collecting rainwater from roofs, filtering it and storing it for reuse, thereby saving energy, lowering carbon emissions and reducing mains water consumption. 
Systems also include a back-up mains water connection, for when rainfall is limited. 
Harvested rainwater is not suitable for: 
• 
drinking 

• 
personal washing, showering and bathing 

• 
preparing food 

• 
dishwashing (by hand or machine). 


However, if stored correctly it can be used for: 
• 
flushing toilets 

• 
washing clothes with a washing machine 

• 
watering garden lawns, plants and flowers 

• 
washing cars.

•

• 
Risk of contamination or cross­connection 

• 
Only certain types of outlet and appliance can be supplied 




Grey-water recycling 
Grey water is waste water that has been used for washing and is generated from hand basins, washing machines, showers and baths. Rather than sending it down the drain, it can be reused for watering plants and flushing toilets, thereby reducing mains water usage. 
There are several different types of grey-water system available in the UK, but they all have similar features, including some form of treatment, a storage tank for the treated water, a pump and a distribution system. 
Grey water should not be used for: 
• 
drinking 

• 
personal washing, showering and bathing 

• 
food preparation 

• 
dishwashing (by hand or machine). 

If grey water is filtered, stored correctly and treated where necessary, it is suitable for: 

• 
flushing toilets 

• 
washing clothes with a washing machine (requires treatment) 

• 
watering garden lawns, plants and flowers 

• 
washing cars.

•

Heat recovery ventilation (HRV) systems 
Heat recovery ventilation (HRV) systems reduce the heating and cooling demands of a building. Installed at the top of a building, they extract warm, stale air and pass it through a heat exchanger. The heat is then drawn to incoming fresh air, which is transferred back into the building. They recover between 60 and 95 per cent of the heat in exhaust air and markedly improve a building’s energy efficiency. 


Energy-efficient lighting 
Energy-efficient lighting not only lowers electricity bills but it also benefits the environment by reducing carbon emissions. 
Incandescent bulbs are inefficient, converting around five per cent of the electricity they use into visible light. Halogen bulbs use the same filament technology as traditional bulbs but run at a higher temperature, making them slightly more efficient. These types of lighting have now been phased out and replaced with more efficient types: 
• 
Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) comprise a mercury-filled glass tube with an inner coating of phosphor powder which glows when charged with electricity. They use around 60–80 per cent less electricity than equivalent traditional bulbs and last around ten times longer. 

• 
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) use 90 per cent less energy than traditional bulbs and have begun to replace CFLs. They turn on instantly at full brightness and are available to fit almost any light fitting. There may be a large number of LEDs within a single bulb to create sufficient brightness. 



. Figure 5.34 Energy-efficient lightbulbs 
Electric vehicle charging points 
New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will be banned in the UK from 2030, resulting in a move towards electric vehicles. These are powered by rechargeable batteries and there are currently three types of public charging point: 
• 
Rapid chargers have outputs of 43 kW and use a Type 2 connector. They are the fastest way to charge an electric vehicle and take between 30 and 80 minutes to reach 80 per cent charge. 

• 
Fast chargers have outputs between 7 and 22 kW and use Type 1 or Type 2 sockets. It typically takes between three and four hours to charge a vehicle. 


• Slow chargers have a three-pin plug, like a home charger. It can take up to ten hours to fully recharge a vehicle. 




Energy labels are a common sight on many appliances, such as white goods, grading them according to their energy efficiency with a letter-based rating. These labels were first introduced in 1995 to drive innovation and help consumers make informed decisions about the products they purchase. However, in 2021 a new generation of labels was introduced for refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, washer-dryers, dishwashers, televisions and electronic displays, and light sources. 
The energy efficiency rating system for these appliances now runs from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). The energy labels also include QR codes, clearer guidance on energy consumption and extra information specific to product types, such as noise levels and water usage for washing machines. 
Energy labels on other appliances, such as tumble dryers, ovens and air conditioners, still use the old rating system of A+++ to G, although there are plans to update these in 2022. For now, the UK is following EU legislation changes, although post-Brexit it also has the freedom to make its own changes. 
Manufacturers are responsible for ensuring their products are accurately labelled. 
Since September 2015, boilers, water heaters and heating products have been labelled in the same way as refrigerators and freezers to show how energy efficient they are. Under the ErP Directive, boilers must be labelled with their efficiency level from G (lowest efficiency) to A+++ (highest efficiency). Boiler manufacturers and retailers are responsible for ensuring their products are accurately labelled. 
Insulation for pipework and ductwork 
All pipes installed in vulnerable or exposed locations inside and outside a building, such as unheated cellars, roof spaces, garages and outbuildings, must be insulated to improve energy efficiency, prevent freezing and retain heat energy. 
Types of pipework insulation include: 
• 
PVC foam 

• 
expanded polystyrene 

• 
extruded polystyrene 

• 
cross-linked polyethylene foam 

• 
expanded nitrile rubber 

• 
expanded synthetic rubber. 

Ductwork should be insulated in order to: 

• 
keep air within the ducts at the required temperature 

• 
prevent ducts from leaking air. 


Ductwork carrying warm air should be insulated to conserve energy. Ductwork carrying cold air should be insulated to conserve energy and control condensation on the outer surface. 
Various thermal insulation products are available for ducting, including rigid preformed slabs or boards and flexible rolls, blankets, mats and mattresses. 
Building insulation 
Insulation is needed to reduce heat loss from a building during cold weather (see Figure 5.37). This in turn reduces the energy required to maintain a comfortable temperature for the occupants. 
Insulation should also reduce the heat entering a building in warm weather. This saves energy by reducing the need for air-conditioning systems. 
There are many different ways to insulate a building, making it more energy efficient and lowering running costs.

. Figure 5.37 Heat loss from a building 


Cavity wall insulation 
Cavity walls are constructed from two leaves of masonry, separated by a nominal 50 mm gap. The outer leaf is usually facing brickwork, and the inner leaf is brickwork or blockwork. Insulating an existing cavity wall involves drilling a series of holes through the outer leaf and blowing or injecting the insulation material into the cavity. 
Cavity wall insulation materials include: 
• 
blown mineral fibre 

• 
polystyrene beads (EPS) 

• 
rigid board insulation 

• 
urea formaldehyde foam. 


External and internal wall insulation 
External wall insulation involves fixing an insulating layer over the existing wall, either mechanically or adhesively, and covering it with a render. 

Where external insulation is not an option, for example in conservation areas, internal wall insulation can be installed. This consists of thermally engineered insulated studs and insulation slabs. 


Loft insulation 
Installing loft insulation, or upgrading existing loft insulation, is the quickest and most efficient method of improving the thermal performance of an existing building. 
Loft insulation materials include: 
• 
blown insulation material 

• 
insulation boards 

• 
roll loft insulation. 


Current building regulations state that insulation materials should be laid to a minimum thickness of 270 mm. 

Floor insulation 
Around 15 per cent of heat is lost through an uninsulated floor. Insulating a ground floor will keep the building warmer and reduce energy bills. This can be done using rigid board insulation. 
Upstairs floors do not need to be insulated, as they are within the thermal envelope of the building.

11.1 Internet of things (IoT) 
The term ‘internet of things’ (IoT) refers to objects connected via a digital network. The potential for integrating the IoT into building services engineering systems is vast, and this is covered in more detail in Chapter 10. 
11.2 Control and monitoring systems 
Building management systems 
A building management system (BMS), sometimes referred to as a building automation system (BAS), is a computer-based system that monitors and controls a wide range of building services, for example: 
• 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) 

• 
lighting 

• 
energy 

• 
fire systems (smoke detection and alarms) 

• 
security systems (CCTV, motion detectors and access controls) 

• 
ICT (information and communications technology) systems 

• 
lifts. 


Successful implementation of a BMS will help building managers to understand how a building is operating in real time and allow them to control and adjust the system to ensure optimum performance and energy efficiency. 
A BMS can provide: 
• 
a visualisation of real-life building data with a graphic user interface, allowing comparisons between buildings and benchmark data 

• 
a method for generating building usage reports 

• 
time scheduling of building operations function, such as lighting, heating and security controls 

• 
notification of faults and failures through a set of alarms and alerts. 


Automated controls 
Automated controls can be used to maximise energy efficiency in a building. 

Movement sensors can switch building services on and off when required, for example lighting. As a person enters a room, a passive infrared (PIR) sensor detects them and switches on the light; when the person leaves, the sensor is no longer able to detect them and turns off the light. 

Infrared sensors are increasingly being used to operate taps, toilets, urinals and shower outlets, particularly in public buildings and hotels. The sensors operate solenoid valves that allow water to flow when the infrared beam is interrupted. These automated facilities not only save water, but they are also more hygienic because they are touch-free. 
Smart controls 
Smart controls allow users to control and monitor a range of building services from a mobile device such as a tablet or phone, for example: 
• 
lighting 

• 
heating 

• 
security 

• 
air conditioning 

• 
ventilation. 


Smart sensors connect to consumer Wi-Fi and have a companion app to control their functionality and set parameters, for example time and temperature. 

Smart meters 
Smart meters are replacing traditional gas and electricity meters. They offer a number of benefits: 
• 
Meter readings are sent automatically to energy suppliers. 

• 
Energy bills are more accurate, as they do not rely on estimates. 

• 
Consumers can see their energy usage in real time and track costs via an in-home display. They can look at how much energy has been used in the past day, week, month and year. 

The smart meter equipment installed by energy suppliers usually comprises: 

• 
a smart electricity or gas meter 

• 
a communications hub 

• 
an in-home display.

The methods of measurement used for construction activities vary depending on the work task and the operational phase of the construction project. 
Well before construction work starts on site, a range of personnel will have taken many accurate measurements in order to design, plan and prepare for a project. Measurements will continue to be taken with accuracy during the subsequent construction phase. 


1.1 The benefits of accurate measurement 
Accurate measurement ensures a project meets the requirements of the client and runs smoothly through to completion for the contractor. 
Benefits to the client 
When a client commissions a project, they have certain expectations: 
• 
The work should be completed within an agreed budget and timescale. 

• 
The design brief should be wholly fulfilled. 



These outcomes can only be achieved if accurate and appropriate methods of measurement are used during all phases of construction. 
During the planning stage, accurate measurement of quantities of materials and components required for the job will mean the right amounts are delivered to site. This avoids a shortage of materials, which can cause production delays, or a surplus of materials, which can cause waste. Resulting cost savings can be passed on to the client. 


Using established principles when calculating required quantities of materials allows for assessment of the time needed to use and install those materials, contributing to the creation of a realistic work programme. Completion targets can then be set to support efficiency and productivity and satisfy the client’s requirements for timely handover of the building. 
Creation of a work programme founded on accurate productivity and avoid potential delays due to shortfalls calculations will also allow workforce requirements in workforce numbers. The client benefits because the for the project to be established, which will sustain project is more likely to be delivered on time.

.
Figure 6.4 A new building must be constructed using accurate measurements 






In order to construct a building exactly as shown in the drawings and in accordance with specifications, it is vital to use accurate and appropriate methods of measurement. 
If measurement principles are not applied correctly, it can cause adverse consequences: 
• 
If a building that is not dimensionally accurate or not built to square is handed over to the client, significant problems can emerge when the installation of items such as floor tiles is attempted, or fittings and modular components such as kitchen units are positioned. 

• 
Using unspecified materials or components may mean the building is not suitable for its intended purpose, for example reducing the width of timbers used in floor joists. 



Benefits to the contractor 
Accurate measurement allows for accurate costing of a project, which in turn can: 
• 
help a contractor to manage profitability and cash flow, to maintain business activity and ensure company growth 

• 
allow a contractor to negotiate with suppliers for favourable prices on bulk materials and specified components, to improve company profit margins. 




Careful use of accurate and appropriate methods of measurement during the construction of a building prevents errors, which may be costly to remedy. It would be especially problematic if errors were discovered once the building was occupied after handover to the client. Avoiding errors means the job runs smoothly and is more likely to be completed on time. 
If a company consistently completes projects on time and to a high standard, by accurately constructing buildings to specification, it will over time build up a good reputation and ensure continuity of work. Carelessness and inaccurate work can quickly destroy a hard-earned and valuable reputation. 


1.2Choosing appropriate methods of measurement 
Throughout the stages of a construction project, different work activities require different methods of measurement. These should always be applied accurately. 
. Table 6.1 Appropriate methods of measurement and the benefits of accuracy . Table 6.1 Appropriate methods of measurement and the benefits of accuracy 
Construction activity  Method of measurement  How the method is used  Benefits of accuracy  
Site survey  Calculation of area  A building must fit on a proposed site, with allowances for roadways, paths, parking and landscaped areas. There should be consideration for adequate space between the new building and existing structures.  Accurate calculation of the area of the site is needed to confirm that the proposed project is feasible. Early confirmation that the site is suitable allows for an appropriate design concept to be created.  
. A survey of a new site must be undertaken  
Locating services on a site . Existing services must be accurately located  Linear measurement  One of the first tasks on a new construction project is to locate the position of any existing services on the project site. Records regarding the position and route of services are used to accurately measure from stated positions on site. Once located, the services will be removed or rerouted.  Finding the precise location of services by accurate measurement is essential so that subsequent site work can proceed safely. Accidental damage to existing services could also cause delays and create added costs.  
Groundworks including removal of topsoil and excavations . Large volumes of material may need to be moved  Calculation of volume  Before a building can be constructed, the soft topsoil must be removed from the area on which the structure will be positioned. To measure the amount to be moved, the volume of material is calculated in cubic metres (m³). Excavations for foundations and underground drainage systems also require calculation of the volume of material to be moved.  Moving large volumes of soil or other similar material involves the use of heavy machinery, which is expensive to hire or buy. Accurate measurement of the quantity of material to be moved means the number of machines and the time needed can be established and the cost confirmed.  
Correctly locating the new structure on the plot . Accurate measurements are needed when positioning a building on a plot  Linear measurement  Project drawings show where a building will be located on a site. Accurate measurement from given reference points is needed to position the building in the correct location.  If a structure is wrongly positioned, it may interfere with other elements of the development, or its position may contravene planning requirements. In extreme cases, a wrongly located building has had to be demolished and rebuilt in the correct position – at great expense.

Construction activity  Method of measurement  How the method is used  Benefits of accuracy  
Building the new structure . Accurate measurements are needed throughout the course of construction  Linear measurement, calculation of area, calculation of volume  Accurate linear measurement is needed to set out the outline of a building, the position of internal walls, doors and windows, vertical dimensions to establish floor and roof heights and much more. Accurate calculation of area will confirm quantities of materials required for activities such as plastering, bricklaying and roofing. Calculation of volume identifies requirements in cubic metres for materials such as concrete or screed required for solid floors.  Accurate measurement of the outline and features of a building is essential if the building is to be constructed exactly as designed. For example, wrongly positioned internal walls may interfere with other design elements. Measurements to calculate quantities of materials must be accurate to avoid shortfalls or excess materials, affecting productivity or adding to costs.  


1.3Costing techniques for different projects 
Construction projects vary greatly in size and complexity. A project may be relatively simple, such as building a boundary wall, or highly complex, such as building a multi-storey office block. 
Calculating the cost of such a wide variety of project types requires the use of different techniques to arrive at figures that are as accurate as possible. Let us look at some frequently used costing techniques. 

Job costing 
This technique is usually applied to specific client requirements for a distinct project or ‘job’. It involves analysing the job in detail, breaking down the costs of each element and tracking and recording them as the job proceeds. 
The cost elements are broken down into labour, materials and overheads. This costing technique is sometimes confused with process costing, where the steps to complete a job are identified and an average cost is applied to each step based on past experience. 


. Figure 6.8 Various techniques can be used to cost a project 
Batch costing 
This can be viewed as an extension of job costing, since a batch (like a job) is broken down into component materials to be costed individually. For example, concrete is manufactured from sand, aggregate and cement. The quantities of the three component materials can be costed separately and those costs totalled as a batch, usually expressed in cubic metres (m³) in the case of concrete. 

Batch costing is often used where the manufacturing process takes the form of a continuous flow of mass­produced construction materials, such as plasterboards or bricks. 
Activity costing 
This technique assigns costs to specific activities rather than whole jobs or processes. Identifying the many activities required to produce a building provides costing data that can feed into the overall costing process. 
For example, the activity of building a brick wall can be costed by using specific information: 
• 
The dimensions of the wall allow the number of bricks required to be accurately calculated. 

• 
The quantity of sand and cement for mortar can be calculated. 

• 
The hourly rate of pay for a bricklayer can be precisely set. 

• 
The number of bricks laid per hour can be established from past work experience. 


By identifying quantifiable activities, the associated costs for materials, labour, equipment and overheads can inform the costing process – both for the current project and also for future projects with similar characteristics. 
Life cycle cost analysis 
This technique is used to estimate the overall costs of a building throughout its entire life cycle. It allows for comparison of alternative building concepts at the design stage, so that an evaluation can be made of which design is most economically and environmentally beneficial over time. The analysis includes the cost of everything throughout the life cycle of the building, including: 
• 
land acquisition 

• 
construction 

• 
energy 

• 
water • operation

Some professionals consider life cycle analysis to be little more than a ‘best guess’ of costings for a building that could potentially be in use for 100 years or more. Over such an extended time period, circumstances may change unpredictably. 
However, with increasingly demanding environmental regulations impacting on building design and operation, refinement of this technique could provide value of a measured number can be changed simply an important tool for costing new buildings that are by moving the decimal point (see Table 6.2 later in this designed to be more environmentally friendly. chapter). 




2.1Units of measurement 

Some standard metric units of measurement and their abbreviations are as follows: 
• 
Length The UK construction industry uses metric units as – millimetres (mm) standard. These are easy to use because they are based – centimetres (cm) on a decimal system which provides a consistent – metres (m) relationship between different measurement units. The – kilometres (km) 

• 
Weight or mass 



– 
gram (g) 

– 
kilogram (kg) 

– 
tonne (t) 


• Liquid 
– 
millilitre (ml) 

– 
litre (L or l). 


Table 6.2 shows the relationships between metric units of measurement and gives examples of how they are applied. 
. Table 6.2 Standard metric units of measurement 



Loadings Loadings 

. Figure 6.11 The measurement unit for loadings is the newton (N) 
These forces are measured in newtons (N). For example, the force exerted by pressure on concrete can be measured as newtons per square millimetre (N/mm²). This measurement is used to classify the amount of crushing force that concrete can withstand. 
Units of area and volume are derived from units of length: 
• 
area is measured in square units, for example square metres (m²) 

• 
volume is measured in cubic units, for example cubic metres (m³). 

Every building must be designed to withstand the loads and pressures created by: 

• 
the weight of the materials it is constructed from 

• 
the weight of equipment and occupants within it 

• 
external forces, such as wind or the weight of snow. 



Even time has a standard unit of measurement – the second (s), which is the basis for time management in every aspect of human activity, including construction. 
Many of these units of measurement we take for granted, using them every day without thinking too much about how they fit together or have an influence in our lives. 
In construction, these standard units of measurement are used in specific ways using appropriate equipment. Let us look now at some measurement techniques. 
2.2Measurement techniques 
Measuring equipment used in construction work can be relatively simple or technically complex. 
Simple equipment such as a tape measure can give accurate results when used carefully to measure: 
• 
height 

• 
length 

• 
distance. 

In any structure, it is important to measure heights accurately, for example of floors, ceilings, door and window openings, and roofs. Any inaccuracies could have serious consequences: 

• 
If the height of a ceiling is not measured accurately during the building process, it may clash with the height measurement of the tops of doors or windows in the room. 

• 
If the height of floors is not measured accurately during installation, a staircase will be placed at the wrong angle of slope, and it may not sit properly where the top of the stairs meets the upper floor. 



. Figure 6.12 Getting a height measurement wrong could have serious consequences 
Accurate measurement of length is also important if the design is to function as intended. Accuracy is vital when measuring the outline of the building, the position of internal walls and the position of doors and windows along an elevation of a building. 



Technically complex equipment can be used to measure height, length or distance to high levels of accuracy. Laser instruments can be used to measure differences in height and 3D laser scanning can be used to give accurate data about the height and length of existing structures during a survey. 

. Figure 6.13 A 3D laser scanner 
Traditionally, an instrument called a theodolite has been used to measure distance and height, using mathematical methods of trigonometry and triangulation to establish accurate angles and measurement details for setting out new buildings or surveying existing structures. 

The optical theodolite has evolved into an instrument known as a total station. This modern surveying instrument combines an electronic version of the theodolite (which can record location data using GPS) with an electronic distance meter to speed up the measurement process. Some versions can even be operated remotely by a single operator and the gathered data can be streamed to an office location for reliable storage. 


To ensure efficiency and productivity throughout the construction process, accurate measurements are important for calculating the quantities of materials required. Calculations of area and volume are used to establish the amount of plasterboard needed for walls and ceilings, bricks and blocks needed for walls, and concrete needed for foundations and solid floors. 

Accurate measurement is also important when establishing the weight or mass of materials and the capability of lifting equipment. There is usually no means of weighing things on site, but the weight of items should be labelled on packaging, and equipment for lifting and transporting materials should have a safe working load (SWL) clearly and permanently indicated on it. 


Legal requirements to make new structures more environmentally friendly have led to the use of specialised measurement techniques for calculating heat transfer and energy use. Energy used in the construction and operation of a building produces carbon. This combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, which contributes to climate change. 
To calculate CO2 emissions, the thermal transmittance of the building’s structure must be established. This is known as the U-value, which expresses the rate of transfer of heat through a structure (or more correctly through one square metre of a structure), taking account of the difference between internal and external temperatures. It is expressed in watts per metre squared kelvin (W/m²K). 

. Figure 6.15 Heat loss expressed as U-values in a typical house 
To control heat transfer in a building, insulation must be used. Measured resistance to heat transfer is expressed as the R-value. The higher the R-value, the more resistance a material provides to heat transfer. 


The standard units of measurement and many of the measuring techniques discussed in this section can be linked to the use of data sources such as Building Information Modelling (BIM). This is a system 
for digital storage, handling and distribution of information and data. Chapter 8 covers BIM in greater detail. 
More traditional data sources, such as drawings, are commonly used to ‘take off’ information for calculating quantities of materials and establishing timescales for work programmes. Let us look at some points regarding standards and practice when using this type of data source. 



Construction drawings are produced to a set of conventions, which include particular units of measurement, views and sheet sizes. Conventions in measurement standards include the consistent use and application of scale when producing drawings as information sources. 


An architectural technician or a draughtsperson produces drawings of a building to scale. This means that large structures can be represented with accurate proportions on a document that is much smaller, so that it is easy to work with. It would obviously be difficult to work with a drawing of a house that was produced at full size. 
Scale is shown using a ratio, such as 1 to 10. This would usually be written in the form ‘1:10’. Using this scale, a drawing of a feature that is 1 m (or 1000 mm) long in real life would be drawn 100 mm long on the paper. This is because 100 mm is a tenth of 1000 mm.

. Table 6.3 Types of drawing and common scales 

In some cases, more than one scale will be used on the same drawing, with different scales being used for different views, perhaps to allow for greater detail to be shown or a wider view to be given in context. A scale drawing may also use more than one unit of measurement, for example to show air-flow velocity in a ventilation system an arrow 1 cm long could represent a flow rate of one metre per second (1 cm = 1 m/s), regardless of the scale of the main drawing. 
3.1Common scales 
Table 6.3 shows the scales commonly used for different types of drawing. 
Type of drawing  Description  Scales commonly used  
Detail drawing  This shows accurate, large-scale details of the construction of a particular item, such as a timber-frame structural corner or the makeup of a suspended concrete floor.  1:1, 1:2 and 1:5  
Floor plan  This shows the layout of internal walls, doors and stairs in a building. In a dwelling, it also shows the arrangement of special­use rooms, such as bathrooms and kitchens.  1:50 and 1:100  
Elevation drawing  This shows the external appearance of each face of the building, with features such as slope of the land, doors, windows and the roof arrangement.  1:50 and 1:100  
Sectional drawing  This is a slice or cut through of a structure to give a clear view of details that would otherwise be hidden. For example, on a working drawing for a house, a sectional drawing could allow us to clearly see the layout of the stairs within the building.  1:50 and 1:100  
General arrangement drawing  Sometimes referred to as a location drawing, this can be used to show a single building element and what it should contain. It can also be used to show the main elements of a structure, such as the external walls, internal or partition walls, floor details and stairs.  1:50, 1:100 and 1:200, depending on the level of detail required  
Site plan  This shows the proposed development in relation to the property boundary. It also shows the positions of drainage and other services and access roads and drives. It may show the position of trees and shrubs if they are required as part of the planning details.  1:200 or 1:500  
Block plan  This shows the proposed development in relation to surrounding properties. It must be based on an up-to-date map and drawn at an identified standard metric scale. It usually shows individual plots and road layouts on the site as a simple outline with few dimensions.  1:1250 or 1:2500  


Show your understanding of how scale works by filling in the gaps in this table: 
Scale size on drawing  Scale  Actual size (mm)  
10 mm  1:10  100 mm  
25 mm  1:20  
1:50  300 mm  
50 mm  1:200  

In order to be used reliably during both the planning and construction stages of a project, drawings should comply with British Standards. 
BS EN ISO 19650 sets out a comprehensive code of practice for managing the production, distribution and quality of construction information, including drawings. It allows for the co-ordination of a range of essential construction data and information. 
To produce drawings that are consistent and can be formatted to suit particular applications, they are laid out on standard-sized sheets of paper. Since different sizes of paper can be used and drawings can be printed and formatted in different ways, it is important that the scale used for drawings is clearly stated. Larger standard-sized paper can be used to produce drawings to a scale that shows greater detail, if required. 
Table 6.4 shows the dimensions of standard paper sizes. Note that the higher the number, the smaller the paper. 
. Table 6.4 Standard paper sizes 
Title  Size (mm)  
A0  1189 × 841  
A1  841 × 594  
A2  594 × 420  
A3  420 × 297  
A4  297 × 210  



When using a drawing to build a structure or install components, written dimensions and measurements on the drawing should be used to ensure the work is completed exactly as designed. Using a scale rule on a drawing to establish dimensions for a work task can lead to errors. However, a scale rule can be used to ‘take off’ measurements from a drawing when calculating quantities, if written dimensions are not shown. 


Costing a project from drawings and other data sources must be done in accordance with ‘rules of measurement’. The rules most commonly used are the New Rules of Measurement (NRM), produced by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). This is a standard set of measurement rules and essential guidance for the cost management of construction projects and maintenance works. Their use helps to prevent disputes and maintain efficiency and productivity. 
3.2Tolerances 
As stated a number of times in this chapter, accuracy when using and interpreting information from a range of data sources is essential if a building is to be completed exactly as designed. However, a building will often be constructed in conditions that are not perfect. In addition, many materials have characteristics that make it difficult to produce a flawless result. 
For example, a concrete foundation or solid floor slab may easily be shown on a drawing with straight lines to indicate its depth and position, but the properties of the material do not allow it to be installed with a perfectly straight profile or edges. 

stated amount. These tolerances will vary, depending on the nature of the material. For example, a double­glazed unit has a very limited range of tolerance – if it is larger than the window frame to be glazed by only 1 mm, it simply will not fit. 

By contrast, when setting out a brick wall, it may be necessary to adjust the size of the mortar joints to fit whole brick sizes into the overall length of the wall, to avoid cutting bricks. In this case, a tolerance of ± 3 mm is allowable. This means that a 10 mm mortar joint can be enlarged by 3 mm to 13 mm or reduced by 3 mm to 7 mm to accommodate whatever is needed. 
Tolerances may also be used to allow for acceptable variations in the strength of materials, the performance of a heating or ventilation system, temperature ranges in which materials can be used and many other situations.

1.1On-site construction 
In the early years of construction, all buildings in the UK were made on-site, with materials often sourced locally from the surrounding land. This led to the development of low-rise dwellings with walls made from heavy timbers, cob or natural stone bonded together with lime mortar, or a combination of these materials. The walls were solid and often built directly on the ground with little or no foundations to support them. Roofs were often pitched with timber rafters and covered with slate or thatch to protect the occupants from the elements. 
Over the years, construction methods have evolved, due to advances in construction design and technology, alongside the ability to use different building materials which are manufactured and transported to site from further away. 
Table 7.1 illustrates how traditional and modern construction methods have transformed the way we build today.

There are many different forms of construction used to build new dwellings. 
On-site construction using traditional methods such as brick and block cavity walls or timber frame can be slow, and progress can often be delayed by adverse weather. 
In the pursuit of building sustainable homes more quickly, with less of an impact on the environment, alternative methods of construction are sometimes used. These might include the use of straw-bale walls or, less conventionally, shipping containers. 
Although the idea of building with straw bales ticks a lot of sustainable-construction boxes, this method is unlikely to be used for large housing developments because of its limitations, for example it can only be used for low-rise buildings, as well as having a limited lifespan and often rustic appearance. On the other hand, the idea of using shipping containers to build is not as extreme as it may first appear, especially if they are converted into habitable spaces in factories and delivered to site in modular form. 

. Figure 7.5 Modular container house 
Besides the construction of most new dwellings on-site, the services and fabric of existing buildings still need to be maintained, and at some point upgraded, while in situ. Cosmetic and structural renovation and refurbishment of buildings are also jobs that are often only able to be completed on-site because of the nature of the work. 
The use of 3D printing and robotics as methods of on­site construction are covered later in this chapter. 
1.2Modular construction 
Modular construction combines pre-engineered units (or modules) to form major elements of a building. These modules are manufactured in factories and then transported to site where they are assembled. 
After the Second World War, there was a housing shortage in the UK. In order to provide homes quickly, many temporary buildings known as prefabs were made using precast concrete sections. However, modern prefabricated buildings are far superior to historical examples, and modular construction is now used to build permanent structures that are comfortable for the occupants, attractive to look at and sustainable. 

Approximately 13 per cent of all new houses built in the UK use modular construction, as it offers many benefits: 
• 
Automated systems improve accuracy and quality control. 

• 
Large numbers of components can be manufactured efficiently with reduced waste. 


• 
By carrying out a large proportion of the construction work in a controlled factory environment, the delays associated with adverse weather conditions on site are avoided. 

• 
Up to 95 per cent of a building can be constructed in a factory, therefore reducing the number of trades needed on site during the assembly and final finishing of the project. 


Due to the cost savings from mass production in factories, standard houses using modular construction can be produced more cheaply and efficiently, with better quality control, than using traditional bricks and mortar. It is also possible to design and construct unique houses in modular form, although these are usually more expensive, depending on the specification. 
Most modular houses are constructed using structural insulated panels (SIPs) or timber frame, although heavier and less-sustainable precast concrete can also be used. SIPs are made using two layers of oriented strand board (OSB) bonded to each side of a polyurethane insulation core to provide a strong, rigid and highly insulated panel. 
There are several types of modular building, each providing a different level of finish: 
• 
turnkey (pre-assembled) – fully finished with plastered walls, fixtures and fittings, such as bathrooms and kitchens 

• 
shell only (pre-assembled) – walls, floors and roof assembled, with no fixtures and fittings or internal finishes 

• 
panel system (flat pack) – the basic elements of the structure provided, ready to be assembled on site. 


Further information on modular construction can be found in Chapter 3. 
. Table 7.2 Work undertaken at first fix 



1.3 First fix 
The construction of a new building is broadly divided into three areas of work, known as structural, first fix and second fix. As the name suggests, structural work includes the main load-bearing elements of a building, such as the foundations, basement (where there is one), walls, precast concrete staircases, floors and roof. 
First-fix building work has a different meaning for each trade, although it is generally considered to be the phase of work completed after the structure has been erected and before plastering commences. 
Table 7.2 outlines some of the first-fix tasks completed by various trades. 
Construction operative/ trade  Range of work undertaken  
Plumber  Installation of pipes through the building for hot- and cold-water systems  
Electrician  Installation of cables and back boxes for switches, electrical sockets, alarms, smoke detectors, CCTV, data-networking cables and television  
Gas fitter/heating and ventilation fitter  Installation of pipes for gas distribution for boilers, underfloor heating, and ducting for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems  
Carpenter  Installation of flooring, door frames, linings, staircases, stud partition walls and windows Encasing services  
Dryliner/plasterer  Drylining ceilings and walls in preparation for plastering, or taping and filling the joints between the plasterboard sheets  


. Table 7.3 Work undertaken at second fix 

on the ceilings or walls may need to be damaged to allow access to the hidden services. 
1.4 Second fix 
Once the various trades have completed their first-fix work and the plastering/drylining is finished, second­fix work can commence. Second fixing often involves the installation of items and equipment that could have easily been damaged or affected by earlier stages of construction work. 
Table 7.3 outlines some of the second-fix tasks completed by various trades. 
Items installed during second fix are still vulnerable to damage from other construction workers and equipment on site, for example tilers, painters and decorators, therefore where necessary adequate measures should be taken to protect them until completion of the project. 
Finishing trades such as tilers and decorators are usually scheduled to work on site at the end of the second-fix stage. It is important that they co-ordinate the completion of their work with the other trades, to avoid getting in each other’s way and to prevent unnecessary damage to their work. 
Further information on first-fix and second-fix tasks undertaken by different trades can be found in Chapter 4. 
Construction operative/trade  Range of work undertaken  
Plumber  Installation of fixtures and fittings, for example sinks, toilets, showers, baths, towel rails and radiators  
Electrician  Installation of electrical fixtures and fittings, for example switches, sockets, fuse boards (power distribution units and circuit protection) and light fittings Testing and commissioning of new electrical systems  
Gas fitter/heating and ventilation fitter  Installation, testing and commissioning of gas boilers and other heating, air­conditioning and ventilation systems  
Carpenter and joiner  Fixing skirting, architraves, doors, kitchens and fitted wardrobes/cupboards  

1.5Self-driving vehicles moving plant used to prepare sites ahead of building work starting. 
Fully autonomous vehicles are not yet ready for operational use on busy construction sites, due to the unpredictable nature of the environment, for example the movement of workers and plant. However, semi­autonomous vehicles, which depend on a small amount of human intervention, are already being used in some areas of construction in the UK, for example earth­


In other countries, semi-autonomous excavators, trucks, diggers and cranes are also being used successfully for simple but time-consuming and otherwise dangerous construction tasks, such as digging, drilling and excavating the ground on site. 
Using autonomous vehicles for construction projects can reduce costs by improving productivity and site progress, because they are able to operate 24 hours a day without a driver. They also produce fewer carbon emissions than vehicles driven by humans, due to less erratic movements and more efficient use. 

. Figure 7.8 Self-driving (autonomous) vehicle 
1.6 Computer-controlled manufacturing robots 
While manual labour will likely always be a huge factor in building projects, the development of robots to automate construction tasks has led to improvements in productivity. They have been designed to undertake repetitive and labour-intensive tasks, such as demolition, laying bricks and blocks and plastering. 
Advantages of using robots include: 
• 
protecting workers from hazards and reducing workplace injuries 

• 
reducing operating costs and waste 

• 
increasing production rates and efficiency 

• 
ensuring accuracy. 




. Figure 7.9 Computer-controlled manufacturing robot 
1.7 Large-scale 3D printers 
Large-scale 3D printers can produce perfectly formed walls for large buildings on demand. They function by controlling a mobile robotic arm on site to ‘print’ cement-based mortar walls, layer by layer, until the full height of the walls is reached. 
The advantages of using 3D printers on-site are similar to those for using robots, however this method also produces seamless walls. 

. Figure 7.10 Large-scale 3D printer 
1.8Drones 
Recent innovations in drone technology have provided the construction industry with a resource that can be used to plan, manage, report and communicate efficiently through a number of digital platforms, for example Building Information Modelling (BIM), Auto CAD and mobile apps on site. 
With the right software, drones can reduce costs and labour needs, and improve the efficiency of construction projects. Typical uses of drones include: 
• 
surveying land using laser scanning (topography, volume and measuring distances) 

• 
producing 2D and 3D maps 

• 
identifying improvements that can be made to infrastructure 

• 
pre-construction site planning, for example traffic­management systems and welfare facilities 

• 
performing maintenance inspections that may otherwise be difficult to complete without the risk of harm, working at height or the use of costly access equipment, for example inspecting a roof 

• 
producing thermal imaging to identify hot spots in a building which could be potential hazards, or cold spots resulting in heat loss and poor energy efficiency 

• 
streaming live footage to the project team with the use of virtual reality (VR) glasses 

• 
inspecting work for quality control 

• 
monitoring progress on site in real time and sharing updates with the project team 

• 
identifying hazards and improving site security. 

The law states that drones used for business purposes must be flown responsibly, following Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations. From 2021, drone operators must also have several licences to fly them safely and confidently. To obtain these, operators must successfully complete both of the following qualifications: 

• 
General Visual Line of Sight Certificate (GVC).

In the construction industry, the structure of a building is looked at in two parts: 
• 
The substructure is the section of a building extending below the horizontal damp-proof course (DPC), including basements and retaining walls. 

• 
The superstructure is the section of a building from the level of the DPC upwards. 



2.1Substructure 
The substructure of a building is designed to bear (support) the weight of the superstructure by transferring the imposed loads down to the ground below. It includes a building’s foundations. Designers, such as structural engineers and architects, usually determine the type and size of foundations needed by considering the following factors: 
• 
type of building (industrial, commercial or domestic) 

• 
size and weight of the superstructure 

• 
build method, for example timber frame or brick and block 

• 
number of levels 

• 
location, for example exposed position where there are high winds or an area that is prone to flooding 

• 
topography of the land 

• 
load-bearing capacity of the ground on site 

• 
impact on the environment and sustainability 

• 
construction costs. 


The weight of materials used to construct a building is referred to as the dead load. This remains constant and can easily be calculated for the design of building foundations. As well as this weight, designers also have to consider variable imposed loads, known as live loads, such as people, furniture, snow and wind. 
If the foundation of a building is inadequate or has been poorly constructed, it will often fail and result in subsidence. If this occurs, the building will partially sink into the ground, either evenly or unevenly: 
• 
A small amount of even subsidence is known as settlement, and this sometimes happens over a short period of time after a building has been newly constructed. Providing this type of subsidence is only short lived, it should not cause any structural damage to the building. 

• 
Where uneven subsidence occurs, it often causes structural damage, which may result in cracking of hard building materials, such as brick and block walls. Cracks in masonry walls usually occur between the openings for doors and windows, where they follow the line of the mortar joints from the ground to the top of the building. 





. Figure 7.13 Subsidence in a building 
It is sometimes possible to undertake retrospective structural work, known as ‘underpinning’, on existing foundations when they are unable to support current loads or proposed additional construction work, for example an extension or loft conversion. This involves digging underneath the foundations, one section at a time, to enable deeper concrete foundations to be created. These are often reinforced with steel. 


The term ‘footings’ was traditionally used to describe a shallow foundation of a wall constructed of stepped brickwork. It can now be used to mean any building foundation below DPC level. 
Foundations are broadly divided into two categories, determined by their depth: 
• 
shallow foundations (less than 2 metres) 

• 
deep foundations (2 metres or more). 


Shallow foundations 
There are several types of shallow foundation, used to construct a variety of buildings: 
• 
narrow strip and trench fill 

• 
wide strip 

• 
raft 

• 
pad. 




Narrow strip and trench fill foundations 
Narrow strip foundations (also referred to as ‘strip foundations’) are the most common type of foundation for low-rise buildings. They are constructed by digging a narrow trench approximately 600 mm wide (the width of a digger bucket, although the width will depend on the thickness of the wall) and the length of the building’s load-bearing walls. Approved Document A provides the minimum widths of strip foundations determined by the type of ground. The foundations have to be deep enough so that frost does not affect them, usually at least 1 metre deep or until load­bearing soil is reached, and approved by a building control officer. 
Traditional strip foundations are built with a layer of concrete filling the bottom of the trench, to provide a strong base for the blocks laid below ground level. Trench fill foundations are very similar to traditional strip foundations, but they have a deeper strip of concrete poured in the trench, just a couple of brick courses below ground level. Trench fill foundations are often cheaper and safer to build than traditional strip foundations, because they are quicker to construct and avoid the risk of the sides of the trench collapsing while bricklayers are working below ground level. 
When the concrete has cured, brickwork is laid directly on top of the foundations up to the damp-proof course (DPC) 150 mm above finished ground level. 
Where buildings are constructed on sloping sites, the narrow foundations are usually stepped up the gradient. This avoids unnecessary deeper foundations on one side of the building and reduces the volume of concrete needed.

Wide strip foundations 
Wide strip foundations are similar in construction to narrow strip foundations. However, they are normally at least 1.5 metres deep and much wider. This provides enough space for bricklayers to work safely in the trenches to build their brick and block walls to the DPC level. They are used to support the superstructure of buildings with heavier loads or where the soil has a lower bearing capacity, for example soft sandy clays, by distributing the weight through the reinforced concrete foundation over a wider area.

Raft foundations 
Sometimes it is impractical or uneconomical to keep digging into the ground until firm soil with load-bearing capacity is found for strip foundations, therefore other types of foundation may need to be considered. 
Raft foundations are often used for small low-rise domestic buildings, because they are relatively quick to construct and use less concrete compared with other methods. 
A raft foundation consists of a slab of concrete reinforced with steel frame, constructed under the entire footprint of a building. The concrete slab acts like a raft would on water, by distributing any imposed loads over a large area to the ground below. Some areas of the raft will have additional loads imposed directly on them from the load-bearing walls above, for example the edge (also known as the toe). At these points, the depth of the foundation is increased to create a ring beam in the slab, which improves the load-bearing capacity of the raft and prevents cracking. 

. Figure 7.19 Raft foundations 


Pad foundations 
The methods used to construct industrial units and commercial buildings are very different to those used for domestic houses. This is because they are designed to be erected quickly and efficiently, by maximising the use of large open spaces for industrial and commercial purposes rather than as places to live. These types of building are usually constructed around a steel portal frame, with suspended external cladding and low­height walls. Most of the weight of these buildings is transferred from the superstructure down through the steel frame to single point loads at ground level. At these positions, square or circular concrete pad foundations are built to support the structure by distributing the imposed loads down to the ground below. 
Pad foundations can also be used to support ground or ring beams. These connect the pad foundations together, so that the weight of the structure can be 

206 
distributed along the beams and down to the pads in the ground below. 

07_20 

. Figure 7.20 Portal frame 
Deep foundations 
In ground conditions where the surface layer of soil is unable to support the superstructure of a low-rise building with shallow foundations or the weight of a high-rise building, deep pile foundations have to be constructed. This involves driving long, pre-cast cylindrical steel and concrete piles deep into the ground until they reach rock or strong load-bearing soil; these are referred to as driven piles. This method displaces the soil as the piles are driven into the ground to provide a strong foundation resistant to downwards and lateral forces. 
Piles that rely on the firm soil around them to support any imposed loads are referred to as friction piles, whereas piles that are supported from below by bedrock or another solid surface are known as end bearing piles. 
Piles are often designed to be evenly spaced at strategic positions around the footprint of the structure, where they are cut off to the same level and connected at the surface with a concrete and steel pile cap, also known as a ring beam. 

Driving deep piles into the ground with heavy plant is an extremely noisy process, which could be a nuisance to the public. Furthermore, the amount of vibration caused in the ground could cause damage to the structure of nearby buildings. To overcome these issues, piles can be cast in situ by boring holes into the ground with long augers (drill bits) and then filling these holes with wet concrete, reinforced with steel; this method of construction is referred to as replacement. 




2.2Superstructure 
As previously mentioned in this chapter, the superstructure of a building is everything above the DPC level on the foundations, including: 
• 
floors 

• 
walls 

• 
roofs 

• 
windows 

• 
frames and doors. 


Roofs 
Roofs protect occupants of a building (and their possessions) from the elements. 
Pitched roof 
A basic pitched roof on a domestic building is traditionally constructed with pairs of common rafters, connected to a spine (known as a ridge board) at the apex. Towards the bottom (foot) of each rafter, a bird’s mouth joint is cut to fit over the wall plates, which are secured to the top of the inner skin of the external walls. These joints provide secure fixing points for the rafters, so that the imposed loads from the roof can be transferred down through the load-bearing walls to the foundations below. 

The sectional sizes of the rafters are determined by the distance they have to span and the weight of the roof covering; guidance can be found in Building Regulations Approved Document A: Structure or the Timber Research and Development Association (TRADA) tables. If the sections of the rafters become too large, it may be more economical to reduce them in size and support them from below, mid span, with a heavy structural beam known as a purlin. These days, metal purlins (and sometimes ridges) are preferred rather than traditional timber ones, because they are stronger, lighter and more durable. 
The process for constructing a basic pitched roof is referred to as a ‘cut roof’ or ‘cut and pitch’. This is because all the timber components are marked out and cut (sawn) on site by highly skilled carpenters. This method has now been largely replaced with prefabricated roof trusses manufactured in factories and delivered to site where they can be erected much more quickly than cut roofs.

Roof trusses 
Each member of a trussed roof is specifically designed and calculated to suit its intended use, for example roof shape, pitch, span and weight of the roof covering. There are many advantages of using trussed roofs, including: 
• 
less waste 

• 
greater energy efficiency 

• 
greater accuracy 

• 
reduced material costs, building times and on-site labour costs 

• 
less-skilled labour required 

• 
lighter and more sustainable materials. 




. Figure 7.25 Nail plate 
Loft space 
The loft space created in a domestic pitched roof can be utilised as living areas, such as bedrooms, bathrooms and home offices. These are either designed into the building when it is initially constructed or completed retrospectively at a later stage. Constructing a loft conversion in a cut roof is generally a simple process, because the arrangement of the rafters and supporting roof members leaves open spaces for the additional rooms, which will require additional steelwork to support a subfloor. However, converting a trussed roof is much more difficult, because the supporting braces have to be removed and the smaller sections of timber trusses result in a loss of structural integrity. 
Where a loft has been designed for a living space, it may be restricted in headroom in some areas because of the triangular shape of the roof. To overcome this issue and to create a source of natural light and ventilation in the loft, the roof may be extended to the back to create dormers. When it is not possible to use dormer windows because of planning restrictions or a tight budget, natural light and extra headroom can be created with standard roof windows, known as skylights, or balcony windows.

Figure 7.28 Balcony window 





Flat roofs 
When a cheaper form of roof construction is needed or has been designed for all types of structures, the pitch of a roof can be lowered to less than 10 degrees to form a flat roof. 
Flat roofs are constructed with a slight fall (pitch or angle) to allow water to run towards the guttering on one side of the roof and the drainage system at ground level. If a flat roof does not have the correct fall, it leads to rainwater sitting on the roof (referred to as ‘ponding’) for long periods of time which could promote weed and moss growth. 
Due to the low angle of a flat roof, some roof coverings, for example slates and tiles, are unsuitable because driving wind will cause them to lift and rainwater could be blown underneath.

Protecting roofs 
The timber framework for a pitched domestic roof is usually protected with a layer of breathable membrane to prevent water entering the building; it also allows any moist air to be ventilated from the loft space. If moist air does become trapped, it will increase the moisture content in the roof timbers above the 20% threshold, leaving it susceptible to an attack of dry rot and possible collapse of the structure. 

A range of products and materials can be used to provide a waterproof covering to protect different­shaped roofs from the elements. For pitched roofs, these include: 
• 
clay and concrete tiles 

• 
natural and synthetic slates 

• 
metal, for example lead, zinc and copper 

• 
fibreglass 

• 
glass 

• 
asphalt shingles 

• 
timber shingles 

• 
thatch 

• 
solar tiles. 

For flat roofs, the following might be considered: 

• 
metal, for example lead, zinc and copper 

• 
fibreglass 

• 
glass 

• 
rubber 

• 
green roofs. 


Warm and cold roofs 
To maintain the energy efficiency of a building and prevent heat loss, all types of roof must be highly insulated to conform to building regulations. The location of insulation in a roof is important, because it determines the dew point. This is the place where warm moist air rising in a building meets cold air from outside to create condensation. 
Pitched and flat roofs insulated between ceiling joists/ rafters are referred to as cold roofs. They must be adequately ventilated along the eaves on both sides of the roof or the ridge where the insulation is between the rafters, to allow moisture to escape. If the moisture does not escape, the dew point may be within the structure of the roof. This is known as interstitial condensation of the roof and can cause rot in the timber rafters and joists. 
The thickness of insulation required in a cold roof is usually determined by the type of insulation; however, where it is positioned between the joists/rafters, a gap of at least 50 mm has to be maintained to provide adequate ventilation. 

Alternatively, a warm roof can be used. This is where reflective foil rigid insulation is placed over the top of the rafters or flat-roof joists with an external grade decking fixed either below or on top, depending on the specification. Warm roofs do not need to be ventilated because the dew point occurs outside the building, and although they are initially more expensive to construct, they are more energy efficient compared to cold roofs. 

External walls (load-bearing) 


Solid walls 
Internal and external walls are classified as either load-bearing or non-load-bearing, depending on the method of construction and materials used. Traditional load-bearing external walls were often made of natural resources, such as stone and cob, because these materials were readily available on the land where they were being used. Although the thermal mass of solid walls kept buildings relatively warm in the winter and cool in the summer, they did not achieve the same levels of energy efficiency as the methods we use now. 



Cavity masonry walls 
A cavity masonry wall actually consists of two walls (referred to as leaves or skins) constructed with a space between them, known as a cavity. The external skin of a cavity wall is usually built with attractive clay facing bricks bonded with 10 mm mortar joints. The internal walls are constructed with cheaper concrete blocks, because they are often covered with plaster or plasterboard on one face, to provide a smooth surface on the inside of the building. 

The internal and external skins of a cavity wall are connected with metal wall ties, built across the cavity into the mortar joints as the walls are constructed. Wall ties improve the load-bearing capacity of the walls by preventing the skins from moving apart and possibly collapsing under the weight from the load above. 
During the 1990s, building regulations changed, making it compulsory to include insulation in all cavity walls to reduce heat loss and improve the energy efficiency of buildings. There are several types of insulation that can be used in a cavity wall; some partially fill the cavity and leave a compulsory minimum 50 mm void to comply with building regulations, while others completely fill it. Where an existing cavity wall does not contain insulation, loose-fill can be retrofitted by blowing it into the cavity through holes drilled into the external wall. Blown-in insulation uses small particles of recycled materials such as fibreglass, mineral wool and cellulose (made from old newspapers), which has less of an impact on the environment than alternative types of insulation. 
If insulation can be built into the walls as they are being constructed, full-fill fibreglass batts could be used in the cavity. These provide low-cost insulation with excellent sound resistance. However, over time the fibreglass batts can settle in the cavity resulting in cold air pockets in the wall, which could result in heat loss. To maintain the air gap in a cavity wall and avoid moisture bridging from the external skin to the inner skin, rigid reflective insulation is often preferred. As a cavity wall is built, the reflective foil sheets are positioned in the cavity and held tight against the internal wall with plastic retaining clips fixed over the wall ties. Although this type of foil faces are highly effective at preventing heat loss insulation is slightly more expensive, the reflective from a building. 

. Figure 7.32 Cavity walls with loose fill, fibreglass batt and reflective foil insulation 

were also used for lintels but these are not as durable as metal, stone and concrete and are therefore rarely specified for external masonry walls on new builds unless they are protected from the weather. 
The sectional size of a lintel and the amount of bearing that it has on the masonry wall either side of an opening will determine its load-bearing capacity. Lintel sizes are usually calculated and specified by 
Stretcher 

Arris the project designer. However, where they span 
face 


distances up to 1.2 metres, they must have at least Header 100 mm bearing on the wall each side of the opening 
face and 150 mm where the opening is greater than 
1.2 metres.

[EN: Once Figure 7.34 is in place, a ‘Weep hole’ label needs adding. See original image ref from author] 
. Figure 7.35 Natural stone lintel 
Weep holes 
Moisture can sometimes penetrate porous brickwork or build up in a cavity wall. To prevent this happening, weep holes are built into the external skin above window and door openings and towards the bottom of the walls, just above ground level. Weep holes are plastic vents, positioned in the vertical mortar joints (known as perps, short for perpendicular) in the external skin of a wall. They allow any build-up of water to escape the cavity to prevent water ingress. 

Closing-off 
Building regulations state that all cavity edges in external masonry cavity walls must be closed off where they are exposed, for example around window and door openings, around vents and at the top of the wall. Closing the cavity at these points improves the energy efficiency of the building by reducing heat loss. It also prevents smoke, dangerous gases and flames travelling up the cavity like a chimney in the event of a fire. 
There are several methods that can be used to close off a cavity: 
• 
Cavity closers can be built into the brickwork around window and door openings. They are available in a range of sizes to suit the width of standard cavity openings. 

• 
The blockwork on the internal skin of the cavity wall can be returned, to reduce the width of the cavity. A gap of at least 50 mm must still be maintained between the internal and external skins to prevent ‘cold bridging’. This joint is then filled with an insulated vertical damp-proof course (DPC), to stop water ingress around the opening in the wall and improve its thermal efficiency. 

• 
Cavity barriers, also known as cavity stop socks, are often used to seal the cavity along the top of the wall to provide fire resistance. 


Note: building regulations will determine the exact requirements for cavity closers and cavity barriers in a cavity wall. 

Internal walls 
Concrete block 
An internal wall used to divide a space is known as a partition. These can either be load-bearing or non-load­bearing, depending on their method of construction. 
Solid concrete blocks are often used to build load-bearing internal walls, because they are cheaper and quicker to build than bricks and also provide excellent sound insulation and fire resistance. The exposed faces of a concrete block wall are traditionally covered with cement render as a base coat and finished with gypsum plaster to provide a flat, smooth surface ready for decoration. 
One disadvantage of this method is the time it takes for the cement render to set, therefore faster-drying backing plasters are now preferred to reduce drying times. Alternatively, the masonry of solid internal walls can be covered with sheets of plasterboard bonded to the wall with drywall adhesive, in a process known as dot and dab. The long edges on the plasterboard sheets used for this process are slightly tapered. This allows for the joints between the boards to be covered with jointing tape and made flush with drywall joint filler. 




Timber partition walls 
Non-load-bearing timber partition walls are more commonly known as stud partitions, because they consist of vertical members known as studs. Studs are usually spaced equally with 400 to 600 mm between the centres of the uprights to suit the size of plasterboard wall covering and to provide support for fixing abutting edges, with extra studs being used to form corners and junctions. 
Each stud in a partition is fixed into a head plate at the top of the wall and along the floor into a sole plate, with two wire nails in each butt joint. The studs are strengthened further with short noggins fixed between them, in positions determined by the height of the wall or where the wall is most vulnerable, for example waist height in a school or hospital. Further noggins may also be built into a partition before it is covered with plasterboard, to provide additional fixing points for heavy items, such as kitchen units, radiators or electrical.

. Figure 7.37 Non-load-bearing stud partition wall 
The arrangement of timbers in load-bearing partition walls is similar to non-load-bearing walls. However, the timbers used must be stress graded. Two head plates must be fixed in these types of walls to spread the weight of any imposed loads and there must be additional structural timbers (lintels) around any openings for doors. Further timber studs should also be used where there are specific heavy loads, for example directly above load-bearing walls. 


Metal stud partition walls 
Metal stud partitions are an alternative solution for non-load-bearing walls. They are often used to divide spaces in domestic and commercial buildings. 
The low-cost, lightweight metal sections of this system are easy to cut and quick to install. In positions where additional support is needed, such as doorways or hatches, the hollow sections of the metal studs are filled with timber to strengthen the wall. The timber inserts also provide strong fixing points for any door or hatch linings that may be fitted after the wall has been constructed. 
Each metal stud section is designed and manufactured with elongated holes in it. These are used to route services through the walls and prevent the need for tradespeople to create holes and notches in the metal studs themselves, as they would have to in timber. 



Floors 
Floors are designed to provide a level surface for the occupants to live and work, while preventing moisture rising from the ground and weed growth. Modern floors are also designed and constructed to: 
• 
prevent heat loss 

• 
prevent the transfer of sound from one level to another 

• 
slow the spread of flames in the event of a fire. 


In domestic buildings, the methods used to construct ground floors are often different to those used for upper floors, mainly due to the increased risk of moisture affecting materials in floors closest to ground level. 
There are two types of floor construction: 
• 
solid floors 

• 
suspended floors. 


Solid floors 
Solid floors are used at ground level. They are constructed using different layers to make a solid concrete base: 
• 
The first layer is compacted hardcore; this consists of materials that are chemically inert and not affected by water. Clean, broken bricks and aggregates or similar unbound materials can be used as hardcore, because they easily drain water and are not affected by the chemicals in other materials in the floor. 

• 
A thin layer of sand blinding is used for the next layer, to protect the polythene damp-proof membrane (DPM). The DPM is a protective barrier to prevent moisture penetrating the floor, which could lead to rising damp in other areas of the building such as the walls. 

• 
Concrete is poured over the DPM to form the floor slab. Also referred to as oversite concrete, this layer provides most of the structural integrity in a solid floor and should not be confused with the finished floor level. 

• 
Sheets of rigid reflective foil insulation are laid over the concrete slab to prevent heat loss through the floor. If an underfloor heating system is being used in the building, it will be fixed either in or on top of the insulation at this level. 

• 
The floor insulation is protected with a thin­polythene sheet, before the final layer of cement screed is laid.

Suspended ground floors 
Traditionally, ground floors were built using timber joists suspended between load-bearing walls, with low-height sleeper walls supporting them mid span. Solid timber floor boards were laid across the joists at right angles and fixed in position with nails. The void underneath the floor was ventilated with air bricks built into the external walls; this created airflow around the timber floor and reduced the risk of rot. 
Suspended timber floors at ground-floor level are not commonly used in modern construction, because the ends of the joists built into the external walls would often suffer with decay from moisture penetration over a period of time, unless they were supported with joist hangers. These days, a durable system known as block and beam is preferred. This involves using reinforced concrete beams infilled with blocks. The floor can be used as soon as the blocks and beams have been positioned on the DPC on the inner skin of a cavity wall, therefore construction work can continue without delay. The exposed block and beam floor is completed with insulation and screed in the same way that a solid floor would be finished. 


Suspended upper floors 
The block and beam system used for ground floors can also be used for upper floors in domestic buildings. However, it is more expensive than suspended timber floors and the additional weight would have to be supported with deeper foundations, which would increase construction costs. For these reasons, suspended timber floors are often chosen by designers for use in low-rise domestic buildings. 
Besides traditional solid timber beams, engineered joists have now been developed to span longer distances unsupported and without the natural defects sometimes found in solid timber, for example twisting, springing and large knots. These joists are wider and lighter than solid joists, making them easier to handle, and stronger joints are formed with the chipboard floor covering. They are also designed so that services such as pipes and cables can easily be laid through them, without weakening them by drilling holes and notches.

. Figure 7.41 Suspended timber upper floor with Eco-joists 

. Figure 7.42 Suspended timber upper floor with I-beam joists 
Where timber suspended floors are unsuitable, for example in multi-storey buildings, pre-stressed concrete slabs manufactured off site can be used. This type of floor is quick to install with the use of a crane. It also has fewer joints than the block and beam system, meaning it has better fire resistance. 
Alternatively, a floor constructed from a concrete slab reinforced with steel can be cast in-situ using formwork (a temporary mould), which avoids the need for expensive cranes. Suspended floors can also be cast in-situ using a lightweight concrete floor system. Rather than formwork, this method uses a steel deck which forms a permanent part of the floor.

Windows, doors and frames 
Windows, doors and frames can allow heat to escape a building if they are not correctly designed and installed, hence they are subject to planning permission and inspection by the building control officer after they have been fitted. 
High-performance, energy-efficient doors, windows and frames can be made from hardwood, softwood, unplasticised polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) and aluminium. Although timber frames are not used as often as the other examples, because they have to be maintained more regularly, they are sustainable and therefore have less of an impact on the environment compared with other materials. 
The type of glass used is just as important as the frames. Double and triple glazing is mainly specified for new construction projects, because the high­performance, low-emissivity (low-E) glass and argon gas filled units act as insulators to reflect heat back into a building to reduce energy bills.

2.3Infrastructure 
Chapter 3 looks at how well-designed infrastructure, including roads, sewage systems, railways and bridges, can contribute to the community and the success of construction projects. 
2.4External work 
External construction work could involve the following: 
• 
paving 

• 
boundaries 

• 
drainage 

• 
parking. 


The infrastructure listed in section 2.3 is subject to planning restrictions and building regulations. Many of the main sewer systems in the UK were initially built in the late 1800s, since when the population has grown substantially, meaning that some of them no longer work efficiently. 
Besides raw sewage, surface water from paving and driveways was directed into the main sewer system until 2008, when new regulations were introduced to prevent flooding and other environmental problems in populated urban areas. The law states that planning permission is not needed if a new or replacement driveway at the front of a property is made from porous materials (sub­base materials and surface finishes) such as permeable concrete, block paving or resin-bound gravel. These regulations do not apply to other parts of a property. Work in or around listed buildings may also need consent. 
Where a kerb lining a path is raised across a new driveway, permission will have to be granted before it can be lowered. The local authority is responsible for public roads and paths and should therefore undertake this task, to ensure that no damage occurs to services under the paving surface and that the lowered kerb is adequately supported. 

Walls that form a boundary between two or more properties are known as party walls. The Party Wall etc. Act 1996 is a framework of legislation that aims to prevent and resolve disputes over boundaries. The law states that you must inform your neighbour if you are intending to build on the boundary, work on an existing party wall or excavate near and below the level of their foundations. Further information on party wall agreements can be found on the following website: www.gov.uk/party-walls-building-works 

3.1Approved documents 
Virtually all new construction work and alterations to existing structures must comply with the Building Regulations 2010. These regulations are developed by the government and approved by parliament. Their purpose is to define the minimum standards of design, building materials and work in the UK. 
To help people understand and comply with the building regulations, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government publishes general guidance on each part of the law in a range of approved documents. These documents provide practical solutions and examples of ways to comply with the building regulations in some common situations, for example water efficiency in a dwelling. 
Table 7.4 contains a list of the approved documents and an outline of their key content.

The British Standards Institute (BSI) produces agreed standards across a wide variety of industry sectors. In construction, these relate to structures, materials and sustainability. 
British Standards (BS) are used as common minimum standards for public-sector projects, covering areas such as BIM, fire safety and waste management. Their purpose is to provide general and specific guidance for the construction industry to improve working practices. 

The BSI also develops Publicly Available Specifications (PAS). These are fast-tracked standardisation documents produced to meet an urgent market need. 
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental organisation that develops and publishes international standards. 
Table 7.5 outlines some of the standards used in construction and renovation.

Any product that has been designed and manufactured in the UK, or imported into the UK, must conform to section 6 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HASAWA) – ‘General duties of manufacturers etc. as regards articles and substances for use at work’. The legislation states that: 
• 
products must be designed and constructed to eliminate risks, so that they are safe while being used, cleaned and maintained 

• 
where necessary, products must be calibrated, tested, inspected and certified to meet with the relevant product regulations 

• 
adequate information must be provided for the safe maintenance, operation and disposal of products 

• 
as far as is reasonably practicable, revisions of information must be supplied if a serious risk to health or safety concerning a product has been discovered. 


Further information on HASAWA can be found in Chapter 1. 

Manufacturers of new products, importers of products and suppliers of significantly refurbished products must provide adequate information concerning safety and the absence of risks to health, and other issues such as the protection of the environment. 
Product information is usually supplied with goods in the form of printed manufacturer’s instructions, with further copies available on the manufacturer’s website. This information will reflect the type of product, article or substance. For example, if the product is a new energy-efficient boiler, manuals should be provided to explain how it must be installed, operated, serviced and maintained to meet the minimum standards laid out in building regulations. 


7.1Structure 
Working in building services engineering, it is important to recognise different building materials and fabrics, their uses and implications. 
Earlier in this chapter, we looked at methods used for the structures of different types of building and some of the materials used, including: 
• 
timber frame 

• 
steel frame 

• 
masonry 

• 
concrete. 


Timber frame 
Timber used for structural purposes such as walls, floors and roofs is referred to as carcassing. All load-bearing carcassing timber must be tested and stress graded to ensure it will support any imposed loads. The most commonly used strength classes of softwoods are C16 and C24, however TR26 is also used to manufacture roof trusses and open web joists. Hardwoods range in strength classifications from D18 to D70, although these are rarely used. 
Some hardwood and softwood species are naturally stronger than others because of their grain and cell structure. However, not all of these timbers are sustainable or suitable for the structures of buildings because of the time they take to grow and their cost. 
• 
Fast-grown commercial softwoods such as redwood, fir and spruce (also known as whitewood) imported from Scandinavia are mainly used for carcassing work. These can be supplied with rough sawn edges or planed straight and smooth. 

• 
Carcassing timber that is planed to uniformed dimensions is referred to as regularised; this is often easier to work with than sawn timber. 

• 
Most timber used for structural purposes has been dried to a moisture content of 16–18 per cent and planed smooth with eased edges (removed with a small rounded edge). This type of timber originated in Canada and is commonly referred to as CLS (Canadian lumber stock) or ALS (American lumber stock). 

• 
Scant is also a type of timber used for the structure of buildings. It is very similar to CLS, but the finished (planed) sizes are usually smaller. 

• 
Sheathing is the timber-based sheet material used to cover one face of a timber frame to provide strength to the structure. Oriented strand board (OSB) is the 



224 
most commonly used type of sheathing due to its strength, durability and relatively low cost. 

• 
Breathable membrane is the moisture resistant material used to protect the timber frame from water ingress, while allowing any moisture in the structure of the wall to escape through it. 

• 
A vapour barrier is a plastic sheet that is usually fixed between a timber frame and plasterboard on the inside face of the wall. The impermeable vapour barrier prevents moisture passing through the wall. Vapour barriers may also be used on floors and ceilings in timber frame buildings. 



. 
Figure 7.45 Timber frame 

. 
Table 7.7 Timber frame 


Timber frame  
Fixings  Nails, screws, bolts, builders’ metalwork, e.g. brackets, truss clips, restraint straps and joist hangers  
Implications  Timber frame is at risk from dry rot, wet rot, insect attack and shrinkage. There may be defects in the timber, for example knots and splitting.  
Hazards  Cutting and drilling create airborne dust.  

Steel frame 
Steel-framed buildings are often made from deep section I beams (also referred to as H beams) and columns bolted together and sometimes welded at the joints to form rigid structures resistant to lateral movement. 
Most steel frames (also known as portal frames) are made from structural steel beams, protected with primer paint. Where the frame may be exposed to the weather, further coats of specialist paint have to be applied, such as epoxy or fire-resistant paint. Alternatively, the frame could be galvanised or made from aluminium. 
. Table 7.8 Steel frame 
Steel frame  
Fixings  Welded joints, bolts, brackets, plates  
Implications  Steel frame is difficult to cut, drill and secure fixings to. It is also heavy and prone to corrosion.  
Hazards  Grinding, welding and drilling activities may result in fire, fumes, projectile debris, hot metal and razor-sharp edges. Cutting and welding expose workers to a very bright light source.  

Masonry and in-situ and pre-cast concrete 
Masonry is a term used to describe bricks, blocks and stone bonded together with cement or lime mortar. Bricks made to construct walls for dwellings are often manufactured from clay, concrete or calcium silicate (sand lime). The colour, texture, strength and porosity of bricks can vary, depending on the choice of materials used and how they are manufactured. 
Concrete is made from a mixture of Portland cement, fine aggregate (sand), coarse aggregate (gravel) and water. British Standard BS 8500 specifies the ratios and size of the aggregates for concrete designed for different uses, for example foundations, paving, reinforced concrete and general purpose. 
There are two types of concrete block: 
• 
Aggregate blocks are manufactured from cement, water and natural or man-made aggregates. 

• 
Aircrete blocks are made from cement, lime, sand, pulverised fuel ash, aluminium powder and water. 


Both types of concrete block are made in a range of different densities and compressive strengths, designed to provide good thermal, acoustic and fire-resistant properties. In general, aggregate blocks are stronger and aircrete blocks are lighter and easier to handle with better thermal-insulation properties. 
. Table 7.9 Masonry and concrete 
Masonry and concrete  
Fixings  Masonry screws/bolts, screws and plugs, chemical fixings, masonry nails, cartridge fixings  
Implications  Drilling large holes with core drills can be slow, therefore hole positions should be planned for in advance. Retrospectively drilling into concrete that is reinforced with steel can cause difficulties.  
Hazards  Cutting and drilling create silica dust and projectile debris.  



7.2Fabric 
Timber 
Natural timber and manufactured timber products are commonly used in the fabric of buildings for stairs, windows, doors, kitchens, frames, skirtings and architraves. Carpenters and joiners are usually responsible for cutting and fixing timber products. 
. Table 7.10 Timber 
Timber  
Fixings  Nails, screws, bolts, brackets, adhesive  
Implications  Timber is at risk from dry rot, wet rot, insect attack, splitting, shrinkage and expansion.  
Hazards  Cutting and drilling creates airborne dust.  

Cladding 
Cladding is the term used to describe panelling that covers or protects surfaces. It can be made of various materials. 
External wall cladding (also referred to as weatherboarding) is usually supplied in narrow widths and long lengths shaped to overlap each board or interlock with tongue and groove (T&G) joints to conceal any movement in the materials and to protect the building from the elements. Timber cladding can be used externally, but it must be treated with preservative, chemically modified (for example Accoya wood) or naturally resistant to water (such as cedar). 
Composite cladding is a durable alternative to timber. It is manufactured from recycled plastic and wood in a range of solid colours designed with woodgrain or smooth finishes. Composite cladding can be cut and fixed just like timber, but it does not need to be painted or stained and will not rot. 
Fibre cement planks are also used for external wall cladding. These are manufactured from sand, cement, cellulose, synthetic fibres and water and designed with a woodgrain or smooth finish. Fibre cement cladding is extremely durable and does not need to be maintained like other products. 
Ceramic and porcelain tiles have been used in kitchens, bathrooms and shower rooms for many years. However, PVC and acrylic resin wall panels are now being used as well, because they are easy to install and they do not have the issues associated with grouted joints.

Cladding  
Fixings  Screws, nails, brackets, adhesive  
Implications  Bare timber may have to be painted or treated if it has been cut or drilled. Composite and timber cladding will expand and contract in different temperatures.  
Hazards  Cutting and fixing create airborne dust.  

Granite, glass, marble, stone and concrete 
Granite, glass, marble, stone and concrete are used to provide attractive, durable and hardwearing wall, floor and work surfaces in buildings. 

. Table 7.12 Granite, glass, marble, stone and concrete 
Granite, glass, marble, stone and concrete  
Fixings  Adhesive, mortar, grout  
Implications  Some masonry surfaces are difficult to drill and fix into.  
Hazards  Silica dust can be created when cutting, drilling or grinding.  

Brick 
Bricks are often used to build the outer skin of external walls because they are strong, durable and attractive. Common bricks, also referred to as facing bricks, are made from fired clay and are available in a variety of colours and textures to suit the building or structure design. Old clay bricks varied in size and shape; however the standard size of a common brick is now 215 mm long, 102.5 mm wide and 65 mm high. 
Bricks are bonded together with 10 mm thick mortar joints and laid so that the vertical joints are staggered, to increase the strength of the wall. The arrangement of the bricks is referred to as the bond. The most common types of brick bonds used in the UK are 

. 
Figure 7.47a English bond (left) and Stretcher bond (right) 

. 
Figure 7.47b Flemish bond (left) and Header bond (right) 



. Table 7.13 Brick 
Brick  
Fixings  Screws and plugs, masonry screws, resin fixings, frame and hammer fixings  
Implications  Fixings should be positioned in the centre of bricks or mortar joints to provide the best fixing points. If a fixing is positioned on the edge of a soft brick it may cause the brick to crack. If the mortar bond between the bricks is not good, it may weaken the fixing; for example, the joints between the bricks are not completely filled with mortar, therefore creating a void and weakness in the wall.  
Hazards  Silica dust can be created when cutting, drilling or grinding.  

Fenestration 
Fenestration is a term used to describe the design and arrangement of windows in a building. Window types were covered earlier in this chapter. 
. Table 7.14 Fenestration 

Plasterboard 
The studwork frames of timber and metal stud partitions are usually clad with plasterboard fixed with drywall screws, before being plastered or taped and filled along the joints. 
Where the studs are spaced less than 450 mm apart, 
9.5 mm plasterboard can be used, otherwise 12.5 mm plasterboard is required. 
There are various types of plasterboard that can be used to clad a partition wall, each with different characteristics. The exact type to be used will be specified by the designers, however it could include one or more of the following: 
• 
standard plasterboard (ivory) 

• 
fire-rated (pink paper) 

• 
thermal (white) 

• 
moisture-resistant (green paper) 

• 
acoustic (blue) 

• 
fixable (enhanced properties to support increased fixing weight) 

• 
impact resistant (ivory). 


. Table 7.15 Plasterboard 
Fenestration  
Fixings  Masonry screws, frame anchors, brackets, frame fixings, expanding foam  
Implications  If windows are not designed or installed properly, they could cause air leakage and condensation and reduce the energy efficiency of the building.  
Hazards  Drilling into different surfaces to secure the frames could create airborne dust. The work is often undertaken at height.

Humans have been gathering and processing data for thousands of years to refine their understanding of the universe. In modern times, working with data has developed into a science that follows defined methods to perform specific tasks. 
Data and information are closely linked. Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, measurements, words or descriptions, that can be analysed and processed so that meaningful information is created. 

1.1Key elements of data 
Every day, vast quantities of data are generated, often referred to as ‘big data’. However, simply collecting masses of data is not the key to creating useful information. Data must be correctly stored, ‘cleaned’ to remove inaccurate or imprecise records, and identified to assign it for use. 

. Figure 8.1 Vast quantities of data are generated every day 
Managing data in this way can involve many complex data-processing systems working together, requiring them to be operationally compatible. This is known as data interoperability. 
Complex processing of data can involve one system describing or analysing data in another system, for example to inform an architect regarding multiple intricate design elements of a building. 

When a set of data is used to describe or analyse other data, this is referred to as metadata. 

The level of detail in a set of data (or dataset) must be regulated or even limited, so that it can clearly inform users according to the required purpose of the information. 
Different data types that can be analysed include: 
• 
numerical – consisting of numbers, such as dimensions and measurements 

• 
categorical – consisting of options, such as ‘type A, B or C’ or ‘up, down, left, right’ 


• ordinal – consisting of steps or sequencing (ordering) of information. 
To allow the extraction of useful information from large datasets, a process known as generalisation can be used. This is essentially a process of ‘pulling back’ from the mass of raw data to give a broader, more general view and reduce the extent of analysis required. This makes information extraction more manageable. 
For example, rather than stating the floor area of dozens of individual rooms in a large multi-storey building, the data could be arranged in bands to categorise room volumes, such as 7–10 m³, 11–15 m³ and so on. This reduces the volume of data while still providing useful information, to allow analysis of requirements such as heating and ventilation systems or optimal occupancy levels in the completed building. 

1.2Different sources of data 
Data is generated from many different sources during the life cycle of a building. 
Data generated during design and construction 
When a building design is conceived, decisions must be made about the shape and size of the structure. Therefore, early in the design process, measurements and dimensions must be established to ensure the design will fulfil its purpose and the completed building will function well for its occupants. 
Quantities of data multiply rapidly as floor areas and volumes of rooms in the structure are calculated, energy requirements are assessed, and thermal performance of the structure is analysed. Calculations will be made to establish structural strength and the forces generated by loadings, to make sure the building will be structurally sound. 




. Figure 8.2 Data is generated right from the beginning of the design process 
Building services systems require extensive data calculations to establish dynamic elements, such as: 
• 
air flow for ventilation systems 

• 
gas supply rates for heating systems 

• 
water flow rates and pressure levels for plumbing systems 

• 
voltage and current ratings for electrical systems. 




As the construction process proceeds on site, data regarding productivity and meeting deadlines is constantly scrutinised to manage efficient interactive working between site personnel. 
Data generated and recorded during a project is valuable. Information about factors such as speed of operations and the effects of delays caused through bad weather or supply issues can be used in designing and building future projects more efficiently and economically. 
A system that is increasingly helpful in managing large volumes of data through the complete life cycle of a building is Building Information Modelling (BIM), which integrates many data sources in a digital format. The system allows authorised users to access a range of important information during the design, construction, occupation and even demolition of a structure. There is more information on BIM later in this chapter, and in Chapter 4, section 8. 

Structures within the built environment must have provisions for access by pedestrians and vehicles, along with reliable connections to services and telecommunications. These requirements mean that extensive transport systems and services delivery infrastructure must be designed, constructed and maintained. 

Useful data can be generated by analysing vehicle and pedestrian movements, metering services provision and examining telecommunications activity. Information harvested from careful analysis can point to emerging trends and help in planning the future infrastructure needs of society. 

. Figure 8.4 Analysis of infrastructure data can help in planning for the future 
Data generated on completion and handover of a building 
When a building is handed over from the contractor to the client for occupation and brought into use, a great deal can be learned from the analysis of data generated by a number of considerations: 
• 
How successful was the delivery of the project by the contractor? 

• 
Was the project delivered and handed over on time? If not, why not? 

• 
Does the building meet its design brief fully now it is in use? 

• 
What changes could be made to improve performance? 


Gathering data to answer questions such as these is referred to as post-occupancy evaluation (POE). It may be undertaken by an independent consultant or by the client’s own team and can provide valuable data to contractors who build repeat structures or specialise in specific project types. 
POE is an increasingly important tool in analysing data to support the construction industry in meeting more stringent environmental targets, and more rigorous regulation connected with energy use. The design of systems delivering utilities such as electricity, gas and water, along with waste-disposal systems, can be refined and improved by analysis of performance data and metering of usage in completed buildings. 
In most buildings, there are systems that automatically control various functions, such as heating thermostats or alarm motion sensors. In large structures, sophisticated computer-based building management systems can be installed to automatically control and monitor aspects such as general energy consumption and distribution, lighting levels, and water management and consumption rates. There is more about digital control systems later in this chapter. 

. Figure 8.5 Computer-based systems monitor and control a range of functions 
Data generated by these systems can be used by estates and buildings managers to understand how buildings are operating, adjust and control systems to optimise their performance, and create reports or set alarms to give an alert when operational parameters are exceeded. 
In the case of large estate facilities, such as a hospital complex or university campus, specialised computer software referred to as enterprise asset management (EAM) can be employed to manage the flow of data. This can inform accounting and purchasing decisions to sustain economic day-to-day operations and support planning for efficient use of individual buildings within the estate. 


Data generated during maintenance 
EAM can be used to collect data about efficiency, reliability and repair costs, allowing planning and work scheduling for maintenance. As inspections take place, data can be logged in real time, and work orders can be sent to personnel already on site to prioritise maintenance or repair tasks. 

. Figure 8.6 EAM can create ‘intelligent data’ to manage the maintenance of a building 
The real-time capture of data using systems like EAM can be linked with BIM systems to create so-called ‘intelligent data’ that can lead to improved efficiency throughout a building’s life cycle. Benefits of this type of interoperability include: 
• 
performance projections for long-term planning 

• 
reliability of building services • operational cost monitoring. 


Data generated, processed and stored using 

1.3 How data can be used 
information and communications technology (ICT) that is managed using equipment in multiple locations 

Table 8.1 identifies how data can be used to complete allows information-rich activities to be conducted in a 
construction projects successfully. 

. Table 8.1 How data can be used in construction projects 

Data use  Applications  
Understanding behaviour  Data can be used to analyse and understand the behaviour of personnel working on a project. Efficient deployment of skilled workers and the creation of workforce motivation to achieve operational efficiency are valuable management skills. Data regarding personnel numbers on site can be referenced to output over time to establish optimum levels of staffing, enabling managers to support efficiency in office environments and on site. In terms of data use, the reference to ‘behaviour’ could be extended to factors that might impact on project success, such as the behaviour of certain materials and equipment in variable conditions. With the emergence of new materials and the progressive adoption of new construction methods, data about how these materials and methods function is of real value.  
Performance assessment  Key performance indicators (KPIs) can be linked to appropriate data to measure performance in areas such as: • monitoring project costs • tracking project progress over time • identifying company strengths and weaknesses • confirming client satisfaction. Uses for performance data include: • tracking profitability by comparing cost with budget • highlighting trends in complaints from clients • evaluating quantities of waste with a view to improving recycling.  
Improving market  When companies bid for contracts, they need to be well informed about workforce  
competitiveness  availability, materials and components procurement, current regulatory requirements and fluctuating economic conditions. Accurate and current data is critical in providing reliable information, so that a company can improve and maintain its success in competition with other contractors. Fully understanding the area of construction activity that a company works in through efficient data analysis is key to making decisions on future company development. Decisions can be made regarding investment in training and equipment needs. Assessment of which types of construction project match the capabilities and experience of a company will help to maintain financial profitability and a reputation for high-quality work.  
Allocation of resources  A company may work on a number of projects simultaneously. This means that assets and resources will need to be actively managed to make best use of them across the range of work being progressed. Data on factors such as personnel placement, work activities, plant and equipment usage, and temporary accommodation on site allows analysis of resource needs and efficient allocation across the range of project commitments.

So far in this chapter we have considered how data is the raw material that can be processed to provide information. The resulting information can then be presented in various ways and used by construction personnel in a range of activities. 
In this section, we will consider different sources of information and how they can be interpreted for use in the workplace. 
2.1Interpreting data sources 
Specific data sources may provide information for workers with designated responsibilities. 
For example, electricians working on the installation of electrical services would not require information about the brick types used in the building to complete their work successfully. However, they would require information about which size and type of cables to use to satisfy voltage ratings, or about switching units or electrical junctions that must be situated in specific locations. 
We can identify specific sources of information and which personnel groups or individuals could use them. 
Product data 
Product data provides information or instructions about how to use or install a product correctly. For example, a manufacturer will often supply information about how to handle and store a product safely in accordance with health and safety regulations, such as the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002. There is more on these regulations in Chapter 1. 


Product data is closely tied to manufacturers’ specifications. These provide very specific information on performance data, such as the temperature range within which installation work must take place or the type of surrounding environment in which the product will operate successfully. 
Manufacturers’ specifications may include key data and information on how a product should be assembled, dismantled, calibrated, adjusted, maintained, repaired, examined or inspected. 
Product data can be used by building designers working in an office environment or by on-site personnel installing a range of systems. Trade workers might use product data to confirm that the materials they are working with are in accordance with specifications for the work task. 


Client specification 
In the Royal Institute of British Architects’ (RIBA) plan of work 2020, the client specification has been defined in part as ‘a statement or document that defines the project outcomes and sets out what the client is trying to achieve’. 
The client’s needs will obviously depend on the type and use of the required structure, for example: 
• 
A client requiring construction of a dwelling may specify the floor areas needed to satisfy the living requirements of the intended number of occupants. 

• 
A client who has commissioned the construction of an office block may specify the levels of light within the building to allow comfortable work in office spaces. 

• 
The specification for a retail development may centre on the project being attractive and convenient for customers to use. 


Information in the client specification must be interpreted carefully in order to produce a design brief that meets the objectives as fully as possible. Professional personnel such as architects, quantity surveyors and engineers will give careful attention to the client specification when performing their work. 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, BIM is a structured system that allows authorised users to access a range of important information at all stages of construction and beyond. It uses digitally processed information to analyse design elements of a building, including 3D modelling. 
Using BIM, complex design ideas can be transformed into a medium that is easier for all personnel to work with. It allows collaboration between all the designers, engineers and contractors working on a project, providing comprehensive information about each role’s workflow. This enhances the process of design and construction and allows exploration of alternative design possibilities before work on site begins. 
BIM allows digital data describing internal building engineering services to be presented and analysed visually, so that the way they interact with each other can be seen. Clashes in systems can then be identified at an early stage in the design process; this is known as ‘clash detection’. 
An example could be drainage system pipework within a building interfering with the route of heating ducts. In the past, this could require extensive redrawing of plans and cause expensive delays if the ‘clash’ was discovered after work had commenced. 


The Common Data Environment (CDE) is a single central source of information used within the BIM system. Relevant documents and data are brought together in a shared digital environment that can be accessed by all authorised personnel collaborating on the project. 

The CDE can contain different types of digital information, including schedules, contracts, registers, reports and 3D models, forming the foundation of shared information on which collaboration can take place. Large amounts of digital data and information can flow in a controlled way through the CDE during the development of a project, making it possible to reduce mistakes and avoid duplication. 

Work program planning 
To ensure work can be completed on schedule and within budget, careful prior planning of the construction process is required. Planning a programme of work is often undertaken using charts that provide data and information about the sequence of activities. 
There are two main documentary methods of planning the sequence of work in construction – Gantt charts and critical path analysis (CPA) (see Chapter 3, section 4.2). 

Commissioning and certification 
Commissioning is the process of confirming that all building systems are installed, tested, operated and maintained according to predetermined operational requirements. Data and information linked to engineering techniques and procedures are used to check the correct installation and function of systems such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning. 
Systems must be confirmed as fit for purpose before complete handover of the building to the client. However, as part of the contract arrangements, there are circumstances where performance testing of systems may continue after the client has accepted handover. For example, some systems are dependent on different weather conditions, and commissioning inspections and adjustments may take place over the first year of occupation. 
Commissioning data and information form a checking and testing format to bring systems into operation and verify that they are in good working order. The testing format confirms specific details and responsibilities, such as: 
• 
the party or parties responsible for each aspect of commissioning 

• 
whether the commissioning process and outcomes must be witnessed (this is a legal requirement in some cases) 

• 
the standards that should be adhered to 

• 
the specific documentation that is required, which can include a record of operations, maintenance and future works. 


A certificate is issued to confirm that installation and operational standards have been met, which must comply with technical benchmarks and criteria set by appropriate organisations. The standards could be set by Building Regulations, the British Board of Agrément, the manufacturer or another recognised certification body. 



. Figure 8.10 Testing an electrical system 
Records of test data from inspections are a valuable source of information for new owners, if the building changes ownership. This is especially true in the case of a large complex structure that may be owned by commercial investors. A building is an expensive asset that must be properly maintained to retain its value. 
In the case of a smaller domestic property, a condition report can be prepared for a new owner or homebuyer. This takes the form of a visual inspection to generate data and information about factors such as the condition of the building’s structure, heating and lighting systems, exterior roof surfaces, attic roof spaces, floor spaces and underfloor spaces. 
Efficient commissioning and reputable certification of a building’s systems, coupled with planned and effective maintenance, will contribute to greater efficiency throughout the life cycle of a building. Operational efficiency can translate into reduced energy needs, which is an increasingly important factor in the continuing drive to reduce carbon emissions. Accurate and appropriate data and information are essential to the success of energy-saving strategies. 


2.2 Using data to calculate outcomes or cost 
The term ‘calculation’ can be defined in different ways, according to the context. It can be used to describe the process of: 
• 
using information to make a judgement or plan something carefully and intentionally, for example to calculate outcomes 

• 
determining something by mathematical or logical methods, for example to calculate costs. 


Data can be used to provide results that meet both of these definitions. 
Calculating outcomes 
When calculating outcomes, data can be used to analyse past or current activities to model what could happen in the future. A familiar example of this is forecasting the weather. Attempting this requires the analysis of past data related to a huge number of variables which, as we see daily, makes a reliable prediction difficult. 
Something more straightforward might be calculating the outcome of using timber of specific dimensions to produce a load-bearing element of a building, such as a suspended floor. Consistent data has been recorded over many years which can be applied to produce reliable structural calculations, ensuring that the proposed design is safe and capable of bearing the required loads. 


Building services engineering elements of a structure produce a wealth of data that has been harvested in differing types of building under varying conditions. This has led to the compilation of charts and tables that can be referred to when designing similar structures. Data from past experience can be used to calculate acceptable operational tolerances in new designs in order to avoid ‘over-engineering’, which could be wasteful and add to costs. 

. Figure 8.11 Analysing data from past projects supports efficient design in new projects 
Calculating costs 
Many databases are used to help cost projects of all types and sizes. They draw on historical costing data and are often designed to track current prices of materials and components, almost in real time. Using up-to-date data for costing a project is vital to avoid cost overruns and accurately assess financial risks in a competitive construction environment. 
Data from across the sector is collated, analysed, modelled and interpreted by the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). This valuable source of data is used by many contractors for projects of different sizes. There are also many other companies and institutions that specialise in providing data for costing a project, such as PropertyData and Bestdata. 
A major project with complex design elements needs accurate data to produce costings that will result in profitability for the contractor and a fair price for the client. Of course, profitability is key to the success and financial health of any size of construction company, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also rely on accurate data for success. A small contractor or even a sole trader benefits from keeping accurate project records to provide data for costing future work.

Data and information sources used in the construction industry are of great value, both operationally and financially. This means they must be stored securely and protected. 

3.1Data storage 
Physical storage 
In the past, data tended to be stored as paper documents and physical drawings. While hard-copy documentation is still used extensively, digital data storage is increasingly used. 
There can also be a crossover between physical and digital data storage, if paper documents are scanned and converted to a digital medium for easier transmission to others in different locations. This can speed up communication of useful data that might be needed urgently. 


Virtual storage 
Virtual storage is the storage of data in a digital format, for example on a computer hard drive, on a portable flash drive or in a location that is remote from the user. 
Remote storage is often referred to as ‘cloud storage’ or ‘in the cloud’. Data is transmitted digitally through a network and then stored on a server. These storage facilities are often owned by specialist companies who use multiple data centres around the world. 
Data files are stored remotely in a number of different ways: 
• 
Public cloud: data is stored in the service provider’s data centres across multiple regions or continents. Users pay the provider based on the amount of data stored. 

• 
Private cloud: data is stored in an in-house storage facility, forming a dedicated environment that is protected from outside access by a firewall. 

• 
Hybrid cloud: this is a mix of public and private cloud storage, offering businesses flexibility and more ways that data can be managed and made available to authorised users. 


Data storage companies must provide safe and secure storage and have facilities in place to back up data to prevent loss. 



3.2Confidentiality 
Some data must be kept confidential. For example, data for a construction project commissioned by the government or a bank may contain sensitive details which could threaten security if accessed by unauthorised parties. 
Confidential data stored in a physical format must be locked away and protected in secure facilities. It may be necessary to consider protection from fire damage, in addition to prevention of unauthorised access. 


Measures to maintain the security of digital data include: 
• 
using anti-virus software and keeping it up to date 

• 
using a system of strong passwords so that access to data is restricted 

• 
using encryption to convert data from a readable format into an encoded format 

• 
installing firmware and software updates as soon as they become available (these often contain security patches and new security features) 

• 
logging off (or turning off) computers and locking them if possible. 


The term ‘hacking’ has become increasingly familiar, referring to theft or manipulation of critical data, usually with malicious intent. Hackers are focused on bypassing the security measures designed to keep them out of data processing and storage systems. Security measures must therefore be rigorously designed, carefully adhered to, and updated when necessary, in order to meet the growing challenge of these attacks. Increasingly sophisticated systems are being devised to maintain the security of digital data. 

The news often refers to ‘cyberattacks’ when describing the work of individuals or organisations who steal data or install damaging software known as malware. Malware can behave like a virus, in that it can easily be passed from computer to computer, or system to system, so that the ‘infection’ spreads. 
A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software, misleading the user as to its true intent. It tricks systems operators into allowing unauthorised access. 





Loss of data can be very damaging to the operational efficiency of construction companies that are managing complex project commitments. Recovery of lost or stolen data has developed into an important activity that uses specialist techniques to beat the abilities of hackers and data thieves. 
Legal requirements 
Data protection in the UK is governed by the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), which came into effect on 1 January 2021. It should be considered alongside the Data Protection Act 2018. All companies that sell goods or services need to comply with these legal texts. 
The aim of this legislation is to ensure that personal data is gathered legally, and that those who collect and hold data protect it from misuse and exploitation. A construction company that stores personal data about its workers should always ensure confidentiality. 


Whether based in a design office or on a construction site, workers rely on accurate information to perform their work tasks efficiently. Graphical documents, in the form of drawings, circuit diagrams or schematics, are an important means of communicating data and information, and they can be presented in paper or digital format. 

4.1 Drawings 
Drawings are documents required at every stage of building work. They are an efficient way of providing a great deal of clear data and information, without the need for lots of potentially confusing text. 
When producing drawings, a technician or draughtsperson will draw the details and features to scale. This means that large components can be represented with accurate proportions on a document that is much smaller, which is more manageable than if they were drawn full size. 

Drawings for construction and installation purposes are produced using conventions. This means that the format and layout of drawings follow agreed standards, allowing the data and information they contain to be consistently understood. 
Standardised symbols are used on drawings as a means of giving information in a simpler way. If all the components and installation details on a drawing were labelled in writing, it would soon become very crowded with text, which could be confusing. 

Where symbols are used on a drawing, they must conform to an agreed standard, so that everyone using the drawing can interpret the information consistently and accurately. 

. Figure 8.16 Basic drawing symbols 
Symbols and abbreviations for construction and technical drawings have been defined by the British Standards Institute. Until 2019, BS 1192 was used to set out methods for managing the production and quality of construction information. This has now been replaced by BS EN 19650 and further amends will be made due to the UK leaving the EU. There are many other British Standards that apply to specific types of construction and technical drawing. 


4.2Circuit diagrams and schematics 
Circuit diagrams are technical drawings that provide visual representations of electrical circuits or systems. They are used to explain a design to electricians and technicians, who will use them during installation, maintenance or repair work. The complexity of drawings will vary, depending on the intended purpose of the electrical system and who will carry out the work. 
Electrical circuits are shown on a circuit diagram using lines to indicate electrical connection routes within the system, with related components shown as symbols. As mentioned previously, diagrams using symbols are often referred to as schematics. Pictorial diagrams differ in that they represent elements of an electrical system using graphic drawings or realistic pictures to provide relevant information. 
Wiring diagrams show a simplified representation of an electrical circuit, usually giving more information about the relative placement of devices and components and their terminal positions. 

Different types of electrical diagram are used for different purposes: 
• One-line (or single-line) diagrams provide a simplified representation of a system, showing the flow of electrical power and how the electrical circuit 
. Table 8.2 Details included in electrical plans 
is connected. They show the major components, such as switches and transformers, using standardised symbols. The representation does not depict the physical size or position of the components. 

• Three-line diagrams are more complex, with separate lines drawn to represent live, neutral and earth (or ground) electrical current. They provide a detailed visual guide for cabling arrangements, switches, fittings and protective device connections. 
Diagrams and drawings for a building provide layout and installation details for use by operatives on site in the form of plans, which include a great deal of data and information. Table 8.2 shows some of the details that can be provided on building and site plans for electrical installation and maintenance. 
Details provided  What it shows  
Wiring  How the wiring and parts of the electrical system such as power outlets are interconnected How switching is arranged and located to isolate individual circuits within the system  
Fixtures  Where fixtures such as light fittings or electric heating units are located in the electrical system, along with details of the electrical loadings they create  
Incoming power lines  Details of the size, voltage, capacity and rating of power-delivery items such as cables, junction boxes and transformers  
Fuses and circuit breakers  Where they are located within the electrical system and what is protected  
Equipment  The location within the electrical system of items such as air-conditioning units, solar panels and generators, as well as their voltage and size  

Remember, drawings and diagrams produced for use on site typically include data in the form of standardised symbols, and in some cases annotations, to clearly explain design and installation details of the building’s electrical systems. 



The term ‘programming’ applies to: 
• 
manually entering commands into a control unit to set up operation routines 

• 
writing lines of code to create a software program that is part of the internal operational command structure of a control unit. 


Information technology (IT) used in the creation of software programs is found in many aspects of daily life. For example, smart phones and smart televisions are familiar items that make use of IT software programming to process and present information. 
The development of software programming skills requires an understanding of an appropriate programming language. There are many programming languages that are designed for specific purposes, such as C++ and Python. 
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has devised a standardised approach to programming digital controllers referred to as IEC 61131, which aims to improve the efficiency and speed of implementing automation solutions in a range of applications. 
Programmable controllers can be found all around us, controlling and automating many important functions. 

5.1 Digital systems 
Digital controllers are used to control systems such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning. These can use appropriately positioned sensors in a large building to transmit data to the control unit. Changes can be made automatically or manually to adjust temperature, humidity or the amount of ventilation, in order to maintain comfort levels for the occupants. 
An example of a familiar digital controller is a domestic heating system control panel, which allows programming of ‘time of day’ on–off timings and can regulate temperature according to data from a room thermostat set at the level desired by the occupants. 


programming at the controller location (sometimes referred to as manual operation mode). The controller may be separate from or attached to the device being controlled. 
Chapter 10 covers digital systems used in construction in more detail. 

5.2IT resources 
Computer-based systems make it possible to control devices remotely through digital communication networks. These systems may be designed to allow a single operator to control a number of devices from a central location (sometimes referred to as supervisory control). This allows the gathering of performance data, which can be used to create maintenance schedules and provide information for troubleshooting faults with equipment. 

. Figure 8.18 A single operator can control many processes through digital IT systems 
‘Smart’ controls are designed to allow remote operation by persons who may not even be in the building. Smartphones can be used to input control data, allowing convenient operation and adjustment of digital systems from any location with mobile telecoms network access. 
For more information on smart controls, see Chapter 5. 

Data harvested from digital control systems in existing occupied buildings can be integrated into BIM systems during the design stage of a new building, to model the new building’s digital control systems. The potential efficiency and economy of important systems in the proposed development can be tested through digital simulations using suitable IT resources such as Simflow. 

This type of ‘intelligent’ digital data management takes the use of computer-aided design (CAD) beyond simply producing 3D models of a structure. This is a highly sophisticated use of data to support the design and construction of environmentally friendly buildings that are economical to build and operate, providing high levels of user comfort and convenience.

Chapter 9 Relationship management in construction 
chapter opener: see attached image 09_00
[09_00 FPO] 


Any group or individual that has an invested interest in the long-term success of an organisation is referred to as a stakeholder. Stakeholders can affect and be affected by the achievement of an organisation’s business objectives. Therefore, it is important that they can work together. 
Internal stakeholders support or have concern for an organisation and benefit from their direct relationship with it, for example employers and employees. If an organisation did not have any internal stakeholders, it would simply cease to exist. 
There is a risk that some internal stakeholders will have conflicting interests. For example, employees want to earn a good wage, whereas their employer may want to reduce outgoings on staff remuneration. To avoid this problem, successful construction businesses keep the number of stakeholders to a minimum and ensure they have a good balance between all of their interests in order to prevent conflict. 
External stakeholders do not have a direct relationship with an organisation and are not employed by it, yet they can still have an indirect effect on it. For example, a building control officer enforcing building regulations will determine the standards that a contractor has to adhere to. 
External stakeholders that do not benefit from a direct interest in an organisation are also known as secondary stakeholders. 
Table 9.1 gives examples of internal and external stakeholders. 
. Table 9.1 Types of stakeholders

Stakeholders will always be present in construction projects, and their influence plays a part in determining success or failure. For this reason, whenever possible, internal and external stakeholders should be selected to suit specific construction projects because of their skills, knowledge and experience working on similar jobs. 


The roles, expectations and interrelationships of stakeholders throughout all stages of a construction project, from design to construction to handover and use, are covered in detail throughout this book: 
• 
hierarchy of project management (see Chapter 3) 

• 
promoting good relationships across the project (see this chapter) 

• 
cost-control measures (see Chapter 3) 

• 
time-management methods (see Chapter 3) 

• 
handover processes (see Chapter 4) 

• 
public relations, including the behaviour of employees outside of work hours (see this chapter) 

• 
follow-up and review (see Chapter 3). 




A collaborative approach to project delivery and reporting is essential to ensure work is completed on schedule, within budget and to the client’s specification. 
Reporting any foreseeable problems before they occur, and working with the project team to resolve them, is essential for meeting project aims and objectives. Collaborative working also ensures projects are completed to the minimum industry standards and building regulations. 
Project teams and other stakeholders that communicate effectively at every stage of construction work are more likely to provide a safe working environment for employees and others that may be affected by work activities. 

Figure 9.3 identifies various stages of construction work when members of a project team need to collaborate in order to achieve a successful project outcome. 
Pre-design stage: preparing design drawings, obtaining planning permission 


Design stage: tender process, appointing the principal contractor/ subcontractors, health and safety file, risk assessments, organising plant and equipment 

Construction: off-site manufacturing, e.g. wall panels and roof trusses; on-site construction

. Figure 9.4 A project management team discussing project progress 


Clients are responsible for initiating and financing construction projects. It is therefore important for contractors to maintain good working relationships with their clients, in order to keep them happy throughout a project and increase the chances of repeat business. 
Contractors need to create a good first impression. This can be achieved through a portfolio of successfully completed contracts and positive testimonials from previous clients. Demonstrating good product knowledge is also extremely important, as the client is unlikely to be an expert and will be looking for guidance to steer them through the project and achieve their vision. 


. Figure 9.5 A contractor meeting with a client 
When a contractor works with a client for the first time, it is essential to establish a good level of trust. This can start during the planning stage of construction by maintaining good lines of communication with the client, such as responding promptly to any messages and involving the client in decision making. Listening to the views of clients at every stage of a project and treating them with empathy is also important in building their confidence. 
Total trust between parties can take time to establish, but just a moment to ruin. However, if a contractor can demonstrate their ability to manage the client’s project efficiently by meeting agreed timescales and working with honesty and integrity, then their professional bond will grow. 
Dealing with clients and employees is just as important as managing a project itself, especially if they have a complaint. The way a contractor responds to negative feedback is important; they need to demonstrate that they are continuously looking for ways to improve, in order to keep clients satisfied and maintain a good reputation. 



When employees collaborate towards common goals without friction or conflict, they create a healthy work environment that improves staff morale. Employees who feel part of a team and are offered the chance to be creative and learn new skills develop positive ‘can­do’ attitudes that contribute to the long-term success of an organisation. 
Teams perform best when individual members are motivated by satisfaction with their roles and everyone has accountability for the part they play. 
09_07 
. Figure 9.7 Employees working together 
Team members will work well together if they can communicate openly, without fear of reprisal. Individuals should be comfortable both asking their peers for help when needed and providing feedback to the team when the opportunities arise. This will create an environment that improves trust between team members and ultimately leads to improvements in efficiency and productivity. 

Conversely, conflict, tension, low engagement and lack of trust in a team will have a negative impact on project performance. 


Team dynamics refers to psychological processes and behaviours occurring in a team that influence its direction and performance. 
People’s personalities and behaviour are often uncontrollable and unpredictable, and they can have either a positive or negative influence on team dynamics. With the right strategies in place to address any issues early on, a good team leader can manage the relationships between team members, in order to keep lines of communication open and ensure active participation and co-operation. 
When all members of a team work collectively, listen to and support each other, they are more likely to resolve challenges and achieve objectives. Signs of positive team dynamics are when members work together without conflict and trust the expertise, knowledge and abilities of individuals within the team. 

Businesses rely on positive team dynamics to generate new ideas and improve performance. It is therefore important to identify poor team dynamics as soon as possible. Signs of negative team dynamics include: 
• 
disruptive work behaviour 

• 
failing to achieve positive results 

• 
not being accountable 

• 
poor decision making. 


Poor team dynamics can cause individuals to feel vulnerable, making them less reliable and less able to adapt to the changing situations that may arise during building projects. 

Employers that embrace equality, diversity and inclusion develop an organisational culture that helps people to achieve their full potential based on their talent, not on factors such as their age, background, race, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation. Employing a talented, diverse representation of society allows different views and ways of thinking to be shared within the organisation, to reflect the local culture and community. 
Organisations that promote the values of equality, diversity and inclusion are often more sociable, productive and efficient, which improves profitability for their shareholders. 




To demonstrate its commitment to equality, diversity and inclusivity, an organisation usually has a written equality and diversity policy, which should be read and signed by all employees as part of their induction. 
The policy should include: 
• 
values 

• 
legal duties 

• 
processes which employees should follow to challenge discrimination or if they have a grievance, for example whistleblowing. 


The policy also helps to identify any staff training needs and how to support them. 


Discrimination is the unfair treatment of someone because of their characteristics. An employer could openly discriminate against certain groups or individuals while recruiting new employees or promoting existing employees within their organisation. For example, they should not advertise for specific age groups or genders, unless they are specifically needed to fulfil the job role. 
Besides the moral reasons for equality and diversity, businesses also have legal duties as outlined below. 
7.1Equality Act 2010 
This is the main piece of equality and diversity legislation that protects people from discrimination at work and in wider society. It outlines the different ways that it is unlawful to treat someone, and it strengthens protection in some situations. 
Under the act, the following are protected characteristics: 
• 
age 

• 
disability 

• 
gender reassignment 

• 
marriage and civil partnership 

• 
pregnancy and maternity 

• 
race 

• 
religion or belief 

• 
sex 

• 
sexual orientation. 




7.2Employment Rights Act 1996 
This act legally protects the personal rights of employees and workers. It covers areas such as: 
• 
contracts of employment 

• 
protection of wages 

• 
zero-hours workers 

• 
Sunday working 

• 
flexible working 

• 
rest breaks 

• 
study and training 

• 
unfair dismissal 

• 
maternity and parental leave 

• 
redundancy payments. 




7.3Employment Act 2008 
This act covers: 
• 
the procedure for the resolution of employment disputes between employers and staff 

• 
compensation for financial loss in cases of unlawful underpayment or non-payment of staff 


• 
the enforcement of minimum wages 

• 
the enforcement of offences under the Employment Agencies Act 1973 

• 
the right of trade unions to expel or exclude members on the grounds of membership of a political party. 


7.4 Human Rights Act 1998 
The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. It sets out fundamental rights and freedoms that everyone in the UK is entitled to, including: 
• 
the right to life 

• 
freedom from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment 

• 
freedom from slavery 

• 
the right to liberty and security 

• 
the right to a fair trial in a court of law 

• 
the right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence 

• 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion 

• 
freedom of expression 

• 
freedom of peaceful assembly and association 

• 
the right to marry freely 

• 
the right to an effective remedy in a national court 

• 
freedom from discrimination 

• 
the right to education 

• 
the right to vote. 


Under this act, people who are not treated fairly, equally and with dignity and respect can take legal action to defend their rights. 




At various stages of construction projects, different parties need to negotiate money, assets or resources in the best interests of the organisation or as an individual. 
Negotiation skills are important in the construction industry, for example when buyers acquire land. Negotiations between buyers and landowners must be managed carefully due to the large sums of money involved. A poorly negotiated deal to purchase land will impact on profit margins when projects are completed and sold. 
Once land has been acquired, planning permission may be needed before building work can start. This involves the project planning team working closely with the local planning department, to develop and negotiate initial concepts into a mutually agreeable proposal. If the initial planning application is refused, there is usually an opportunity to appeal the decision at a hearing, where negotiation skills will be tested once again. 

. Figure 9.13 Local authority planning committee 
In situations where a client already owns a building plot, they will usually select a principal contractor through the tender process and award the contract after carefully negotiating the terms. For more information about principal contractors and the tender process, see Chapter 4. 
Different negotiation techniques are needed during the construction phase of building work, for example when changes occur to the original contract agreement (change orders) or time extensions may be needed to avoid penalty clauses or to resolve disputes with subcontractors. 
8.1Distributive negotiation 
Distributive negotiation is used to haggle over a common single interest at stake, known as a fixed sum. 
A fixed sum is best described as a pie that parties are battling over for a bigger slice, with exchange offers back and forth. If one party gains more of the pie through the distributive negotiation, then the other party loses a percentage. 
When preparing a bargaining strategy for a negotiation, both parties should have a preconceived goal. This is the point at which they would walk away without a deal, known as the reservation point. 
Due to the nature of this method of negotiation, it is not possible for both parties to have a whole pie each. However, a mutual agreement can be reached where one party has a smaller slice of the pie, providing they have accepted a deal no less than the reservation point. 

8.2Win–lose approach 
This is probably the most common negotiation method used to settle disputes between two parties. However, an agreement is more difficult to reach, because one side has to compromise in order for the other to experience a positive outcome. 

If the win–lose approach is used to negotiate the distribution of resources, bitter disputes could cause conflict between the parties and may damage their future relationship, especially if negotiations break down and one party walks away. 
8.3Lose–lose approach 
Sometimes during business negotiations, all concerned parties end up worse off and not achieving their desired result, for example unavoidable financial cuts within an organisation due to low annual profits. 
In these situations, all participants should try to minimise their losses as much as possible, and to make sure they are fair. Even though participants are no better off using the lose–lose approach, their relationship remains intact because the loss has been evenly distributed. 
8.4Compromise approach 
Negotiations between professionals to find an acceptable middle ground can be time consuming. When negotiators are unable to reach a mutual agreement and have nothing more to negotiate with, they often make concessions in order to meet the needs of the other party or to get something else they want. 
The compromise approach is used to settle disputes quickly by one party settling for less than it may have hoped for, in order to reduce strained negotiations and maintain or fix a relationship. The risk is that one party gives up much more than it should, resulting in financial loss. 

8.5 Integrative negotiation (integrative bargaining) 
This type of negotiation takes place between parties with common interests, in order to collaborate in 
finding a mutually beneficial solution. It is used when multiple issues have to be agreed. 
Negotiators often make trade-offs across the issues being discussed and add further issues into the negotiations to create additional value for all parties, so that a successful outcome can be achieved. 
8.6Win–win approach 
In this approach, negotiators with shared interests work together to find resolutions they are both satisfied with, rather than seeking to fulfil self-interests. This avoids disagreements and helps to maintain strong relationships between parties, while achieving a fair outcome for both sides. 

Working in a fast-paced industry such as construction can be very rewarding. However, there can sometimes be conflict between the management team, subcontractors, suppliers and client. 
Disputes can occur for several reasons, such as: 
• 
ambiguous contract terms 

• 
breaches of contract conditions 

• 
late supply of building materials, resources or equipment 

• 
breaches of site rules, for example failing to wear mandatory PPE 

• 
programme delays. 


People working at all levels in the construction industry will experience the pressure of having to meet tight deadlines while working long hours. This can have an impact on their physical, physiological and mental health, and is also a contributing factor when conflicts occur. 
Initial grievances may be verbal exchanges, although these could escalate to formal written correspondence, for example emails and letters. Wherever possible, conflict should be avoided, because litigation can be a time-consuming and costly process; it may also damage professional working relationships between the development team and the client. 
If a dispute occurs, each side will compete for their best interests using one of a number of conflict­management techniques, in order to force the other side to concede or reach an amicable agreement. 
There are no benefits to conflict, so it should be avoided to prevent friction between staff, a negative working environment and delays to a project. Building Information Modelling (BIM) (see Chapter 4) can be used as a preventative measure by identifying issues that could provoke conflict between parties before they become a problem. When changes or alterations occur to a project design or specification, BIM can be used to update all concerned parties. 

256 
A dispute can quickly heighten emotions, unless a conflict-management technique is used. One way to resolve a problem is for parties to have an informal discussion in a neutral environment, where both sides have an opportunity to air their views without fear of backlash. If an amicable agreement cannot be reached however, the dispute will have to be resolved using mediation, conciliation or arbitration. 
9.1Mediation 
This process involves appointing a mediator – an impartial third party who uses negotiation and communication techniques to encourage participation from both sides to find common ground and resolve their dispute. 
One side cannot force another to use mediation; however, agreeing to follow this route can avoid the financial expense of going to court. 
9.2Conciliation 
This is similar to mediation. An unbiased conciliator is appointed to meet with the parties separately and together, to weigh up both sides of an argument. They will then make a proposal based on the relative merits of each side, to find an amicable solution to the matter and bring it to a close as quickly as possible. 
9.3Arbitration 
During this process, an appointed arbitrator (or tribunal hearing) resolves disputes between parties. When both sides of an argument have been heard, the arbitrator makes a legally binding decision, known as the award. If either party disagrees with the decision, they can take the case to court. 


Communication is the process of exchanging information from one place, person or group to another. 
The success of any project depends on accurate and effective lines of communication throughout the hierarchy of the construction team. Inaccurate, ambiguous, incomplete or confusing information can lead to delays, missed deadlines, initiated penalty clauses and additional project costs.

. Figure 9.14 Three-part communication process 
Information can be exchanged verbally, non-verbally or in the form of visualisations (graphics). While there are advantages and disadvantages to each of these methods, information should always be clear, comprehensible and in a format that is easy to understand. 

. Figure 9.15 Graphical communication – a safety sign 
Complex information received by two or more people can sometimes be interpreted slightly differently by each recipient; just because information has been sent and received does not mean it has been understood as the sender intended. To confirm the recipient has fully understood the information, feedback needs to be given to the sender. However, this is not always possible using some forms of written or graphical communication. 
The number of methods used to communicate in the construction industry has grown substantially in recent years, with the development of new digital platforms and technology. 


In this section, we will look at some of the most commonly used methods of communication, their advantages, barriers to their effective use and problems that can occur. 
Verbal communication 
Face-to-face communication and indirect communication, such as talking on the phone or using walkie-talkies, are the simplest, quickest and probably most frequently used methods of transferring information from one person to another. Working in the construction industry, you will interact with your colleagues each day to build good working relationships, trust and confidence. 
When team members engage positively and have respect for one another, they are generally happier, which in turn creates a better working environment. Top-down positive communication is a sign of a strong management team, which can result in employees having increased confidence in their employers, being more productive and having less desire to leave their jobs. 
Negative forms of communication, for example in terms of pitch and tone of voice, cause conflict in the workplace, damage staff morale and increase stress levels. They often create passive-aggressive behaviour in individuals and a toxic culture, impacting on the business’ performance and causing an increase in staff turnover.

communication, for example raised voice, gestures or  
body language.  
• The sender can use both open and closed questioning  
(open questioning allows someone to give a free-form  
answer; closed questioning requires a response from a  
limited set of answers such as ‘yes’ or ‘no’).  


Non-verbal communication 
People can communicate with each other without the need to speak, using written information, body language, gestures and even the way they dress. 
Wherever possible, formal communication in a work environment is written down, because it provides a permanent record and is easier to distribute to others without misinterpretation. 
Written information in some forms is a legal requirement, for example building contracts and policies. When information is recorded, it can be referred to or even used as evidence if a dispute or grievance occurs between employers, employees or clients.

Besides written communication, non-verbal communication can involve body language and behaviours such as eye contact and facial expressions. However, these methods can be easily misinterpreted and there is no permanent record. 


. Figure 9.18 A job interview 
Visualisations (graphics) 
Information displayed in a graphical form, such as posters, safety signs and notices, is often used in the construction industry to reinforce information already communicated by some other method. For example, during a site induction you may have been told to wear a range of personal protective equipment (PPE); mandatory safety signage displayed around the site may also illustrate this requirement. 
Technical information is often communicated using detailed visualisations, either in hard-copy format or using digital technology.

10.2Communication styles 
Communication styles can be either formal or informal: 
• 
Formal communication is used by organisations to pass information through prescribed official channels, following an organisational structure. 

• 
Informal communication is much quicker, because there are no rules restricting which direction or lines of communication have to be used; therefore, it is ‘free flowing’. 


The number of non-English-speaking workers, and those who speak English as a second language, is on the increase in the UK construction industry. All employers have a duty of care to communicate effectively with everyone under their control, especially when it concerns their health and safety. To overcome these problems, employers may use a translator or a bilingual supervisor or co-worker to interpret key information. Where this is not possible, they may have to translate written information to use for site inductions, toolbox talks and other training materials. In situations where language is a barrier, simple pictorial illustrations are also a useful tool to support employers communicating with their employers. 


Every employee in the UK has legal rights and responsibilities under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Employment law controls employees’ rights at work and relationships between employees, employers, trade unions and the government. 
As soon as someone accepts a job offer from an employer, they technically have a contract of employment, so before starting work it is important that they understand what they are entitled to and what to expect from their employer. A contract of employment does not have to be in writing, although most employers prefer to record the following terms of the agreement to avoid confusion or disputes: 
• 
employment rights 

• 
employee’s duties 

• 
responsibilities – employer to employee 

• 
responsibilities – employee to employer 

• 
employment conditions. 



11.1Employment rights 
Wages 
Minimum wage 
Almost every person with a legal right to work in the UK has employment rights, such as being entitled to the national minimum wage and living wage. The minimum wage a person should receive depends on their age and whether they are an apprentice: 
• 
Workers of at least school-leaving age are entitled to the national minimum wage. In England, you can leave school on the last Friday in June, if you will be 16 by the end of the summer holidays. You will have the following options until you are 18: 

– 
Spend 20 hours or more a week working or volunteering, while in part-time training or education. 

– 
Stay in full-time education. 

– 
Start a traineeship or apprenticeship. 



• 
Workers over the age of 23 are entitled to the national living wage. 



. Figure 9.20 An apprentice tradesperson 
The rates of the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage are reviewed on 1 April every year. To check the current rates, visit www.gov.uk and search for national minimum wage or national living wage. 
Apprentices who have completed the first year of their apprenticeship and are aged 19 or older are entitled to the minimum wage for their age. 
If an employee is absent from work for at least four days in a row and has earned at least £120 per week, their employer must pay statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. Employers can pay more than the minimum SSP; this is usually agreed in the contract of employment before starting work. 
The law states that employers must give their employees payslips as proof of their earnings, tax paid and any other deductions, for example pension contributions. 

Pension 
Everyone who has made National Insurance contributions through their earnings is entitled to a government state pension, which can be claimed on reaching state pension age (although this is currently under review). The amount a person receives depends on their National Insurance record. A state pension alone is unlikely to provide enough money to live on when someone retires, therefore they will also have either a workplace pension (set up by their employer) or a private pension (set up by the individual). 

Since 2012, all employers must automatically enrol their employees into a workplace pension scheme and make contributions towards it, provided they are aged 22 or above and earn over the low-income threshold set by the government. 
All eligible employees make their pension contributions through deductions taken directly from their income. If an employee prefers not to have a workplace pension, they can opt out of the scheme. However, this is best done within the first month of employment to prevent payments going into a pension fund that can only be accessed when they retire. 

Time off 
Almost all employees have the right to paid leave for public duties and responsibilities, such as jury service, under the Working Time (Amendment) Regulations 2007. People who work a five-day week are also entitled to at least 28 days’ paid leave each year, which is equivalent to 5.6 weeks of holiday. Part-time employees have the same entitlement as full-time staff, although this is dependent on the number of days that they work, for example four days per week amounts to 4 × 5.6 weeks = 22.4 days per year. 
Employees who are parents of children under the age of 18 may also be eligible for unpaid leave to look after their child’s welfare, providing they have been with a company for more than one year. 
Employees over the age of 18 are entitled to three different types of unpaid rest breaks: 
• 
rest breaks at work – one uninterrupted 20-minute break if they work more than six hours a day 

• 
daily rest – at least 11 hours between shifts 

• 
weekly rest – 24 hours’ uninterrupted break each week, or 48 hours each fortnight. 

Employees are entitled to 52 weeks’ statutory maternity leave, made up of 26 weeks’ ordinary maternity leave and 26 weeks’ additional maternity leave. Statutory maternity pay (SMP) is paid for up to 39 weeks and includes: 

• 
90 per cent of the employee’s average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first six weeks 


• either a fixed sum set by the government or 90 per cent of average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks. 
When an employee’s partner is having a baby, adopting a child or having a baby through surrogacy, they might be eligible for one or two weeks’ leave or paternity pay. The weekly rate for paternity pay is 90 per cent of average weekly earnings. Employees may not be entitled to both paternity leave and pay, but they may be eligible for shared parental leave and pay. 
There are different eligibility criteria for birth, surrogate and adoptive parents to get shared parental leave and pay; further information can be found at www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay. 

. Figure 9.22 Parental leave 



Equal rights 
Under the Equality Act 2010, people at work and in wider society are legally protected from direct or indirect discrimination, victimisation and harassment. See section 7.1 of this chapter for details of protected characteristics. 
Health, safety and welfare 
The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HASAWA) protects the health, safety and welfare of: 
• 
people at work 

• 
those who could be affected by work activities. 


An employer’s legal duties under this legislation are explained in Chapter 1. 
Access to representation in times of grievance 
Occasionally, an employee will raise a problem, complaint or concern with their employer that cannot be resolved amicably without intervention. 
A grievance is usually raised with an employer following internal procedures laid out in the contract of employment. This often involves notifying an employer in writing at first, and then following this up with a meeting between the employer, a representative from the organisation’s human resources department (if appropriate), the employee and a companion of the employee’s choosing. Employees can represent themselves, although they may exercise their legal right to take a representative from their trade union or a colleague for support. 

Redundancy 
Employers and employees must adhere to the terms of the employment contract until it ends, when the employee is given notice or dismissed. 
If an employee who has worked for the same employer for two or more years is made redundant, they are normally entitled to statutory redundancy pay. The amount of pay received depends on the employee’s age at the time of leaving and their length of service (although this is capped at 20 years). 
11.2Employment responsibilities 
Employers have responsibilities to their employees to make sure they are treated fairly, by maintaining good practices and complying with employment law. 
Employers’ responsibilities towards their employees include: 
• 
protecting their health, safety and welfare, for example by providing personal protective equipment, toilets and rest facilities 

• 
providing a contract of employment 

• 
informing and consulting when necessary 

• 
being an inclusive employer and not discriminating while recruiting, employing or promoting staff 

• 
paying the minimum wage, sick pay, maternity pay, holiday pay and other entitlements 

• 
allowing staff to return to the same job after a leave of absence, for example after maternity leave or a 


sabbatical 
• 
following the Working Time Regulations 1998 

• 
abiding by the terms and conditions of the contract of employment 

• 
considering requests from staff for flexible working 

• 
auto-enrolling employees into a workplace pension. 




example working conditions, health and safety, standards, procedures and reasonable behaviour expectations. It also provides employees with details about the rules that everyone responsible for using personal data has to follow, in order to protect the confidentiality of people at work and to comply with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (see section 3.2 of Chapter 8). 
Company handbooks often contain a social media policy and code of conduct. These documents explain rules which employees should follow outside of their working hours, to ensure their behaviour does not impact negatively on the employer or damage their brand or reputation. Improper or illegal behaviour by an employee can sometimes prevent them performing their job role as outlined in their job description, and may lead to disciplinary action or dismissal by their employer. Furthermore, they could be prosecuted by external enforcement bodies, for example the police, if they have committed a criminal offence. 



In principle, people should treat others the way they would like to be treated themselves. This is essential to the long-term success of a business and the route to making a better environment in our workplaces and the world around us. 
When you think about ethics, you should consider how the actions you take could affect others. For example, a business may choose not to provide PPE for employees as a way to increase its profits; however, this is considered unethical because of the risk to people’s health. 
Larger businesses often develop a system of policies and practices to ensure they operate in a fair, moral and legal way; this is known as a code of ethics. Businesses with a consistent set of values and robust moral code develop a strong ethical culture, which means they are less likely to face the consequences of unethical behaviour. Unethical behaviour in business is damaging and can have a negative impact on an organisation’s future prospects. 



Table 9.6 provides examples of ethical and unethical behaviour in business. 
. Table 9.6 Ethical and unethical behaviour in business 

Ethical behaviour  Unethical behaviour  
• Adherence to health and safety legislation and guidance • Equality and diversity • Fulfilling the terms of building and employment contracts • Honesty, integrity, commitment and loyalty • Corporate social responsibility • Environmental protection • Accurate business statements • Protection of personal or sensitive data • Fair employment rights and responsibilities • Adherence to laws • Respect • Accountability for actions • Submission of accurate and true annual accounts to HMRC  • Ignoring health and safety legislation and guidance • Discrimination • Failure to honour commitments • Corruption • Harassment, for example sexual harassment • Disregard for corporate social responsibility • Wilful damage to the environment, for example inappropriate disposal of waste or destruction of protected trees • False business claims • Disclosure of sensitive personal information • Mistreatment/exploitation of employees, for example paying below the minimum living wage or offering poor working conditions • Sabotage • Disrespect • Defamation of a competitor • Tax avoidance and manipulating accounts • Theft • Bribery • Money laundering • Deception  

Businesses that demonstrate ethical traits and encourage and reward good attitudes are often more productive and successful, as they develop trust between the management, the employees and the public. When a business with power is seen to be acting responsibly and unselfishly, it can also improve its reputation. 


Organisations need to create opportunities to meet new customers and develop relationships with contacts and partners for new business ventures. 
Networking is a low-cost process used by many organisations to make initial introductions with likeminded people, share information and form long-lasting business relationships. Construction businesses can network on construction sites, attend trade events or exhibitions, join networking groups or use social media. Distributing business cards is another way to expand a networking community, although this method is often slower and restricted to a small demographic compared with the use of digital media. 
The internet is used by most construction businesses in the UK to market their product or service, raise their profile and develop people’s interest for future sales opportunities. A professionally made and managed website is essential as a platform to advertise and promote a business to the public, customers and other stakeholders. 


Businesses can use social media to engage quickly with a wide demographic. It allows them to share ideas, knowledge and good practice with other businesses, through posts, blogs, podcasts, articles and videos. 
Businesses that use social media often provide customers with the opportunity to write reviews, as a way of giving unfiltered honest feedback, although it may not always be positive or constructive. Some businesses also use social media to their advantage by redirecting traffic from posts to their main website, as a marketing strategy to increase sales. 
Social media must be controlled carefully by an organisation. It can quickly and easily damage both reputation and brand if errors are made or negative feedback is received and publicised. Due to the fast pace of social media, businesses have to continually monitor and update their content to ensure it remains current and has not been abused with unwanted or inappropriate posts. There is also a risk that confidential information could be accessed by hackers or leaked online, unless a good cyber security system is used to protect it.

The term ‘internet of things’ (IoT) refers to the system of applying unique digital identifiers to physical objects, such as buildings, which can be connected to a digital network. Communication data can flow between the connected objects, allowing interactivity and collaboration to achieve specific goals. 
Objects connected through a digital network can be referred to as ‘smart’ objects, when the processing of information and data happens without human intervention. Communication can take place directly from machine to machine (M2M). This means that systems management and decision making can be automated in operational areas of a smart building, such as: 
• 
monitoring and optimising systems performance 

• 
detecting systems inefficiencies 

• 
alerting remote operators to potential problems 

• 
diagnosing possible causes of problems. 



. Figure 10.1 In the IoT, communication can take place from machine to machine 
The potential for using the IoT in construction applications is vast. Designing buildings and infrastructure elements to incorporate interconnected and unified sensors and monitoring equipment allows data analysis, which can translate into: 
• 
reduction in energy use 

• 
improvements in manufacturing efficiency 

• 
improvements in safety 

• 
streamlining of materials delivery and supply-chain activity. 



Smart technology can help building designers to identify optimal construction materials and methods for future projects, leading to the construction of buildings that rely less on highly skilled workers, use fewer resources and produce less carbon. 
The interconnected nature of the IoT allows data analysis which can provide performance information on individual components and materials in a range of structures. As a result, manufacturers can improve and refine manufactured resources. 

. Figure 10.2 The interconnected nature of the IoT allows for many applications 
Smart technology is evolving quickly, and the term ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI) is becoming more familiar. AI describes digital systems that go beyond simply following programmed instructions. They use methods of analysis that identify patterns and correlations, in order to draw appropriate conclusions more quickly than humans are able to. 


. Figure 10.3 Controlled access to a construction site using a fingerprint reader 
Data analysis using AI holds the promise of real­time autonomous decision making when operating buildings systems. It also offers the ability to compare different features, options, costings and performance factors during the design of a new building. 
Smart learning that uses digital technology and the networking capability of the IoT is likely to become an integral feature of future design processes and operating systems in the construction industry. 



1.1Uses of digital technology 
The development and implementation of digital technology, in both the construction industry and society generally, has led to new methods of working, with technological tools being refined constantly. 
Let us look at some uses of digital technology in the operation of completed buildings and during the construction phase. 
Digital technology used in completed buildings 
Completed buildings that are designed to integrate with the IoT can produce large quantities of useful data. 
Sensor technology and data management systems embedded in a structure can record and archive data, as well as produce live data streams, for analysis and evaluation. This allows a clear understanding of the performance of an occupied building and the environment it provides for its occupants. 

. Figure 10.4 Sensor technology embedded in a structure can provide valuable data 

Occupier comfort 
In buildings such as offices, smart control systems can be used to monitor and adjust levels of relative humidity, air temperature, ventilation, dust and even air pressure within individual rooms, in order to ensure a comfortable and productive working environment. 

Analysis of data over time can be used to refine the operational parameters of control systems, in turn creating and maintaining consistently comfortable working and living conditions. 
Experts in AI and smart technology suggest that control systems in the future may be able to sense in real time whether a building’s occupants are tired, too hot or too cold, and automatically make adjustments to heating and ventilation to enhance wellbeing. 



Power management 
Digital technology can support energy efficiency through the management of electrical power. Demand for electrical power in an occupied building will fluctuate depending on the number of occupants active at certain times. Intelligent systems can gather and compare information over time to detect changes in energy use and potentially predict periodic peaks and troughs in demand. 
Through the IoT, energy suppliers could request that consumers command their internal systems to reduce energy consumption when increased general demand puts stress on supply capacity. This model of real-time management of demand is likely to play an increasingly important part in improving efficient energy usage. 
Sustainable electricity generation for individual properties, for example in the form of solar panels and wind turbines, is increasing. However, these energy sources may not provide sufficient amounts of energy for larger buildings, which may still need to rely on external energy supplies. 
Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power provide variable energy outputs dependent on weather conditions, so it is necessary to balance the use of on-site and off-site energy sources in a building according to the demand from occupants. 

. Figure 10.6 Digital technology allows sophisticated control of electrical power 
Systems using AI and the IoT have the potential to make these decisions in real time, using a constant feed of up-to-date information. In order to optimise energy use and minimise the production of carbon, sophisticated control systems could make decisions to use on-site energy generation, store energy in battery facilities, export energy to the National Grid, use only external energy sources, or combine some of these options. 



Maintenance 
Benefits of digital technology include the vast quantities of data that can be processed and the speed of data transfer. AI systems can compare a huge range of scenarios based on live data streams, from which warning signs of equipment failure can be identified. This allows predictive maintenance to be a reality. 
A building is an asset which must be managed and maintained efficiently in order to preserve its value. The development of AI systems that can detect potential faults and anomalies in equipment means that maintenance interventions can be made before that equipment fails. 
Equipment failures cause disruption that can be costly and even dangerous to the building’s occupants, so digital technology is a valuable tool in asset management and maintenance of the built environment. 

Digital technology used during the construction of buildings 
While some types of digital technology have been used in construction for many years, especially during the design process, new technologies are constantly being developed to improve site safety and efficiency and make construction more sustainable. 


Design 
Computer-aided design (CAD) has become a standard design tool when developing the concept for a construction project (see later in this chapter for further details). 


. Figure 10.7 Digital tools can produce 3D models of a structure 
Digital tools are able to generate accurate materials and components lists from 3D models or 2D drawings. These can be linked digitally to materials costs databases, in order to produce an up-to-date costing for a project. 
Speeding up the process of designing and costing a project, coupled with the ability to update or amend project details quickly, streamlines development and improves productivity. 
On site 
Once project design details have been finalised and costings completed, digital technology has a significant role to play on the construction site. Smart equipment, such as surveying tools that use satellite positioning data for setting out buildings, can link with remotely stored project data through the IoT. This type of 
273 

equipment is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can speed up site preparation considerably. 
A similar smart approach can be used to avoid damage to existing buried pipes and cables when excavating a new site. Mechanical excavators can be equipped with satellite positioning equipment in order to locate pipes and cables, and digital depth controls can assist operators in limiting the depth of excavations to safe levels. 

. Figure 10.8 It is vital to avoid damage to buried cables and pipes on site 
Smart technology can also support the efficient operation of machines on site. For example, removing too much material when shaping the ground will require some material to be replaced later, which is uneconomical. Smart equipment in earth-moving and excavation machines can ensure pinpoint accuracy in levelling the ground and creating gradients and slopes when contouring the terrain. 
Digital tracking systems can also be installed in machinery. Geofencing uses digital technology such as RFID or GPS to pinpoint the location of construction equipment and create a virtual boundary, ensuring that it remains within a specified area. 




Materials and resources 
Delivery of materials and components to site must be reliable and consistent, in order to avoid project delays and increased costs. However, storage of materials on site is often limited due to congestion and a lack of suitable storage space. 
A strategy developed in the car manufacturing industry known as ‘just in time’ (JIT) can be used in construction activities to improve efficiency, reduce waste and eliminate the need for extensive on-site storage facilities. 

A JIT strategy requires delivery of the right materials, in the right order, in the right amount, at the right time. For example, concrete is usually mixed off site to the required specification. It must therefore be delivered at the right time and in the right quantity to allow it to be poured at the required location before setting occurs. 
There are many software packages designed to facilitate JIT systems. 




Digital engineering uses a digital skillset to create and edit data as part of a design process. Engineering principles are applied in a virtual environment, allowing designers to explore a range of design possibilities and develop innovative solutions to design problems. 

In this section, we will discuss three main techniques applied in the field of digital engineering: 
• 
simulation 

• 
animation 

• 
modelling. 


2.1Simulation 
Simulation uses digital methods to mimic the behaviour of real systems and processes. It helps to answer important questions about a proposed construction project, such as: 
• 
Will the building design be energy efficient? 

• 
Which construction methods are best suited to the design concept? 

• 
What is a realistic timescale for the construction of the building? 



By using a simulation model, ‘what if’ analysis becomes possible, so that the design and selected construction processes can be checked for feasibility. For example, it can be confirmed that the intended building plot will accommodate the design, allowing access to deliver and store materials without causing undue disruption to surrounding properties and their occupants. 
The sequencing of project stages can be simulated, so that construction processes follow a smooth path without disruptive clashes. Any necessary changes can be made before work commences on site, avoiding errors and expensive delays. 

. Figure 10.10 Simulation software can assist in planning and design 
Simulation can also be used for structural analysis. Performance data harvested from past projects can be used to model the behaviour of materials and components in the planned project, to ensure the proposed design is capable of carrying the stresses and loadings that will be imposed on it. 

When retrofit or restoration work is planned, simulation can be used to ensure the existing structure can accommodate new materials or components without overloading or stressing load-bearing elements. 


2.2Animation 
Visualising a completed building and imagining how it will function can be difficult when simply viewing a 2D drawing or diagram. While a 3D digital model can deliver an impressive view of a project, the viewer’s experience can be greatly enhanced if that model is animated to help them focus on key elements. 
Digital animation is a powerful tool that can be used for refining conceptual details of a project. It can provide an engaging and lifelike view of a building, often by creating a walk-through to show room areas and features. This has many benefits, such as the ability to: 

• 
visually assess the effects of lighting and the proportions of room sizes 

• 
gauge the number of occupants who can use the internal spaces 

• 
evaluate the access to and movement of occupants in shared spaces and corridors to ensure safety and comfort. 





2.3Modelling 
So far, this section has considered how simulation and animation use digital modelling to assist in designing buildings and planning construction work. However, digital modelling can also be used throughout the life cycle of buildings. 
For example, sophisticated digital modelling is used to survey existing buildings, in order to collect data that can be used for: 
• 
assessing maintenance and repair requirements 

• 
planning restoration projects 

• 
carrying out alterations and extensions 

• 
making decisions on demolition methods at the end of a building’s useful life. 


A laser scanner can be used to create 3D imagery of a building’s complex geometry or survey surface areas that are not easily accessible. From its setup position, it can digitally record the precise distance of densely grouped points at rapid speed. This process is often referred to as a ‘point cloud survey’. 

. Figure 10.13 A laser scanner 
The point cloud data generated by laser scanning can be integrated into Building Information Modelling (BIM) software or CAD systems to digitally create detailed 3D models of a structure or features of the built environment for a range of uses. Laser scanners can be mounted on drones to capture the exact contours of landscapes, road layouts, railway routes and even entire towns. 


. Figure 10.14 Laser scanners can be mounted on drones for surveying 
A major advantage of using digital technology in this way is that 2D or 3D digital models and representations of structures can be easily amended and instantly shared by being transmitted to other users anywhere in the world. 

The scanned data can be utilised in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR). A VR user is visually completely shut off from the outside world by wearing a head-mounted display (HMD). Whatever input the user sees through the HMD becomes their ‘reality’, allowing them to experience a digitally generated scene as if they were part of it. 

The HMD senses user movement, so that when the user looks up, down or from side to side, the scene they see tracks their range of movement over 360 degrees, to give the sense of looking around a space within the virtual building. 


Multiple users can enter this virtual world to collaborate on design decisions, making the process more creative and efficient. Often, a client will have definite ideas about how they want their project to be completed but they may not be able to express their ideas clearly to designers. Using immersive technology, the designer can accompany the client using the virtual representation of the building to confirm that the proposed design fully matches the client’s expectations. 




Digital technology is widely used in many industries to achieve specific user-defined results. Manufacturing, research, transport, medicine and a host of other sectors routinely make use of digital technology in order to operate and grow. Systems and processes using digital data are often taken for granted in our daily life, for example in items such as mobile phones and computers. 
Table 10.1 details some of the benefits of using digital technology in construction, especially in relation to planning and organising a project and monitoring the construction phase. 
Benefit  Application  
Accuracy  Digital technology allows large volumes of data to be processed with high degrees of accuracy. Data concerning measurements, costings, projections and evaluations can be cross-referenced and linked in complex ways to produce rich and valuable assessment data. This can inform reliable decision making and forecasting during the planning of a project and the monitoring of progress during the construction phase.  
Accessibility  Digital data can be stored and retrieved quickly and easily. Data can be accessed by anyone who is authorised to use relevant networking systems, regardless of their location. This encourages collaboration and allows data to be instantly updated or modified.  
Efficiency  Digital networks can be permanently open to authorised users, allowing efficient working in both local teams and global partnerships across different time zones. Whether working in teams or in isolation, working simultaneously or sequentially, effective work patterns can be created and refined to respond to current needs in maintaining efficiency.  
Risk reduction  Digital simulation of construction operations can be used to identify areas of operational risk. Analysis of accident and injury data allows the identification of emerging trends, possibly due to inappropriate behaviour or incorrect work practices. These can be mitigated by the rapid introduction of safer work methods – risk assessments and method statements can be matched more closely with actual working patterns and conditions.  

Chapter 10 Digital technology in construction 

There will no doubt be intriguing opportunities in the future to take advantage of the power of digital equipment, computer modelling and smart technologies. 
3.1Robotics 
Industries such as car manufacturing use robotics with digital control systems to assemble components repetitively. 
There are some repetitive activities in construction, where industrial robots are already being used or are being developed, for example in off-site construction. This involves the manufacture of parts or sections of a building away from the site location. The manufactured items are then transported to site, where they are assembled to complete the building. Off-site construction is often referred to as ‘prefabrication’ and may involve modular construction methods. For more information on off-site construction, see Chapter 7. 

. Figure 10.16 Robotics can be used for repetitive construction operations 
When manufacturing sections of a building, the use of robots has many benefits, including: 
• 
consistent quality standards 

• 
a regulated work rate that allows for reliable scheduling of materials deliveries to the factory 

• 
accuracy and efficiency (so less waste) 

• 
enhanced safety standards, as there is reduced human involvement. 





Other types of robots that could be used in the construction industry include: 
• 
inspection robots that can reach areas that are difficult or dangerous to access 

• 
maintenance robots that can clean and repair buildings safely 

• 
3D-printing robots that ‘print’ components or whole buildings 

• 
demolition robots that safely dismantle unstable or fragile structures. 



3.2 CAD/CAM 
CAD/CAM refers to software that is a combination of two processes – computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). 
As mentioned above, CAD is a digital tool used to create 2D and 3D representations and drawings during the design process, which allows simulation, testing and refining of ideas to arrive at a satisfactory finished design. 
CAM uses digital geometric data to control manufacturing machinery, such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines which have motorised tool positioning and manoeuvring capabilities controlled by pre-programmed computers. 

The combination of CAD and CAM results in a faster production process that provides dimensional control and ensures product consistency. By using automated systems that can work around the clock, the need for skilled production workers is reduced. However, these systems still require input from trained personnel who set up and program the machines and monitor and intervene when problems arise. 




. Figure 10.19 A CNC cutting machine being set up to perform repetitive tasks 
Digital processes such as CAD, CAM and BIM can be integrated, in order to save time and achieve complex outcomes without the possibility of human error in interpreting drawings and written instructions. 
For example, a 2D or 3D CAD drawing of a building consists simply of lines to represent its shape and the component parts within it. If the CAD data is linked to BIM, the combinations of simple lines can be allocated grouped geometric patterns, features and dimensions. 
This can allow automatic generation of a range of accurate views of a component, along with details of the materials it is made from, so that a CAM machine can manufacture it.

1.1 Business types 
There are many different types of business that operate in the UK construction industry, ranging from individuals trading on their own to national public limited companies employing thousands of people across the country. 
Some business structures are not designed for everyone because of the size of the organisation and its legal status. However, as a business grows it may need to change to a more appropriate business model. 
The advantages and disadvantages of each business type have to be considered carefully, because there could be serious legal implications if trading unlawfully. 
In this section, we will look at the following types of business: 
• 
sole traders, for example a self-employed tradesperson 

• 
partnerships, for example an architects’ practice 

• 
limited companies (private, Ltd, or public, PLC), for example construction companies 

• 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), for example construction companies 

• 
not-for-profit organisations, for example Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) 

• 
community interest companies (CICs), for example local community development trusts 

• 
franchises, for example building maintenance businesses. 


Sole traders 
As soon as someone registers with HMRC as self­employed, they are effectively a sole trader. As a proprietor, they own and have full control of their entire business or enterprise, although they can employ other people to work for them. 
A sole-trader business can operate under the name of its owner. However, if the proprietor would prefer to use a different business name, they must register it at companies house to prevent another company trading with the same name. 



. Figure 11.1 A sole trader 
Operating as a sole trader is one of the simplest business structures to run, because there are fewer tax responsibilities (such as filing accounts with Companies House) and therefore less administration. However, a sole trader is still responsible for the day­to-day management of their company and: 
• 
accurately recording expenses, sales and profits 

• 
running payroll 

• 
filing annual self-assessment tax returns with HMRC 

• 
paying National Insurance contributions 

• 
paying value added tax (VAT) if annual turnover exceeds, or is likely to exceed, £85,000. 



A sole trader is personally liable for any losses or debts (for example to the bank, HMRC or suppliers) that the company may incur if things go wrong. Creditors can legally recover any money owed by the debtor from their business or their personal assets such as their house. If the debt is considerable and the individual is unable to pay, they could be made personally bankrupt. This could result in further difficulties, for example being unable to obtain any type of credit such as a mortgage, credit card or finance on a vehicle because they are deemed to be a high risk. 

Partnerships 
Partnerships are businesses owned by two or more individuals. Partners share the costs, duties and risks of managing a business together, although they may delegate certain responsibilities to their employees. 
Each partner’s share of the profits is based on the partnership agreement between all stakeholders and can be determined by looking at the amount of money they invested in the business and/or the level of involvement they have in the day-to-day running of the business. It is possible to have ‘sleeping partners’ who have no involvement in managing the business but who contribute financially. 
Each partner is personally responsible for paying tax and National Insurance contributions, based on their share of the profits, and must therefore register for self­assessment tax returns with HMRC. 
A nominated person must be chosen to manage the partnership’s business accounts and file its annual tax returns with HMRC. 



. Figure 11.2 A nominated person filing a tax return 
There are three different types of business partnership: • ordinary partnership 
• 
limited partnership 

• 
limited liability partnership (LLP). 


There are no special responsibilities for an ordinary partnership other than those described above. 
Limited partnerships have to be registered with Companies House. They must have at least one general partner and one limited partner: 
• 
General partners are responsible for managing and controlling the business and are liable for any debts that the business cannot repay, in the same way as a sole trader. They can apply for the limited partnership to act as an authorised contractual scheme (ACS), which means that the partners co-own the assets but only pay tax on their share of the profits and are exempt from paying corporation tax. 

• 
Limited partners are not responsible for the management of the business and are only liable for any debts up to the amount they have contributed. 


A partner cannot be both general and limited at the same time. 


A limited liability partnership (LLP) can be created (incorporated) with two or more partners. While it can have any number of ordinary (non-designated) members, it must have at least two designated members. 
Designated members have responsibilities to manage the business, for example: 
• 
registering the business for self-assessment with HMRC (individual LLP members must also register separately) 

• 
registering the business for VAT, if annual turnover is expected to be over £85,000 

• 
keeping accounting records 

• 
completing self-assessment and VAT returns 

• 
preparing and signing annual accounts and filing them with Companies House 

• 
sending an annual confirmation statement to Companies House. 

A formal LLP agreement should be written to outline: 

• 
how members can join or leave the LLP 

• 
the roles and responsibilities of members 

• 
how decisions are made 

• 
how profits are shared among members. 


Having a legally binding agreement in place when the business is first set up avoids potential disputes or complications between partners at a later stage of trading. 
LLPs are sometimes preferred to other types of business because they clearly define their partners as individuals when it comes to earnings, unlike corporations. They also protect the personal assets of partners as a separate legal entity from the liabilities of the business. 
As with any partnership, if there are only two members and one leaves, the LLP may have to be dissolved. 




Limited companies 
Businesses often change their legal status to limited when they become more established, because it gives clients more confidence that the business is a credible organisation. Other benefits of limited companies include: 
• 
protection of owners’ personal assets from any 

business debts • owners given complete control of their business 

• 
no requirement to pay National Insurance 

• 
lower rates of tax 

• 
more tax relief than sole traders. 


A disadvantage of being a limited company is that information about the directors, shareholders, registered office and yearly financial statements is on public record. These details are visible not only to the general public, but also to the business’ potential competitors. 

Private limited companies (Ltd) 
A private limited company (Ltd) is a business that is legally registered with Companies House. It is referred to as incorporated, meaning that it has been made into a corporation that is a separate legal entity, with its own rights and obligations. The main benefit of a limited company is that the owners and shareholders have limited liability, so their personal assets are protected against any business debts up to the value of the money that they have invested. 
As with any business, a limited company and its owners (known as directors) must be registered with HMRC and complete annual tax returns, regardless of whether any duty is owed. Annual business accounts must be filed with HMRC, Companies House and shareholders at the end of each financial year. 
Directors of the business are paid in the same way as its employees, through the pay as you earn (PAYE) system, and they do not have the flexibility to withdraw money from the company without restrictions or tax consequences. This means that tax and National Insurance are calculated and deducted from salaries, rather than the directors and employees having to complete annual self-assessment returns with HMRC. 
At the end of each financial year, the board of directors considers whether to distribute any profits among the shareholders or reinvest the money in the business. Payments made to shareholders are known as dividends; these can vary in size, depending on the amount of investment shares that have been purchased. 
The limited company is responsible for paying PAYE duty to HMRC either monthly or quarterly, and any corporation tax annually. There are strict deadlines for filing tax returns and making any payments due, with potential penalties or fines if they are not met. Therefore, most businesses employ an accountant to complete their accounts, or a larger company may have an in-house accounts team. 

. Figure 11.4 A limited company 

286 


Public limited companies (PLC) 
A public limited company (PLC) is similar to a private limited company. The main difference is that money can be raised for the business through investors (for example the public) buying shares on the stock exchange. 
This type of business benefits from many tax and National Insurance advantages up to a certain value of its profits, including: 
• 
paying less corporation tax 

• 
better dividend payments for shareholders 

• 
pensions 

• 
reinvesting money back into the business. 


For a company to change its legal status to PLC, it must have at least two shareholders and a minimum of £50,000 worth of shares to be issued. As with a private limited company, a PLC must be registered with HMRC and Companies House and file tax returns. 
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
In the UK, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are defined as follows: 
• 
small – employs on average no more than 50 people and has an annual turnover of £10.2 million or less 

• 
medium-sized – employs on average no more than 250 people and has an annual turnover of £36 million or less. 


In 2020, 99.9 per cent of all businesses in the UK were SMEs, which represents the employment of the majority of the working population. These businesses play an important role in the country’s economy because of the jobs and tax revenue that they generate. To encourage further growth and innovation, and to help keep these enterprises in business, the government regularly offers various incentives, such as better access to loans and favourable tax treatment. 
Not-for-profit organisations 
As the name suggests, these are charitable businesses that do not make a financial profit. They often seek to provide a public service or social benefits for individuals or communities in need. 
These types of business are usually run by a board of directors that use similar management techniques to for-profit organisations. However, any money earned is used to cover operational costs and reinvested back into the organisation to pursue its objectives or goals. 
The type of management structure adopted often depends on whether the organisation is limited, a legal charity or an unincorporated association with voting members. 

A not-for-profit organisation can be started by anyone without any money, although they are often funded through charitable donations, grants or self-funding. In many cases, they also have tax-exemption status. However, they are still obligated to deduct tax from their employees’ wages and complete annual company tax returns with HMRC. 
A successful not-for-profit organisation will demonstrate ethical standards and practices, such as trustworthiness, openness and accountability. This instils public and government confidence in the organisation, resulting in greater financial investments in the future. 


Community interest companies (CICs) 
The aim of community interest companies (CICs) is to provide a benefit for the community or trade with a social purpose. Unlike not-for-profit organisations, they are expected to make a profit, which is predominantly reinvested in the company or used for the community they are set up to serve. However, returns to company owners and investors are allowed, as long as they are balanced and reasonable, and a dividend cap must be put in place. A CIC is primarily about benefiting the community and not making a private profit. 
Franchises 
Successful and profitable businesses may look to grow further by creating a franchise. 
A franchise allows a business to expand quickly with lower capital outlay by selling the rights to the business name, logo or trademark and business model to self-employed entrepreneurs, referred to as franchisees. By operating under the banner of an established business with a proven track record, a franchisee can seek to replicate the success of the bigger brand. 
It is sometimes more beneficial to buy a long­term franchise than start a business from scratch with a new name, because of the business system (processes, suppliers and other resources), existing customer loyalty and support provided by the franchisor. New businesses often take years to establish themselves with a strong customer base before making a profit, whereas they are more likely to be profitable from the outset if they have invested in a franchise. 
Business support provided for a franchisee often includes: 
• 
marketing (promoting the business) 

• 
recruitment of personnel (human resources) 

• 
provision of training and equipment 

• 
provision of resources, for example machinery or vans 

• 
assistance from head office 

• 
collaborative networking with other franchisees 

• 
dealing with suppliers 

• 
financial planning 

• 
accounting. 




Once an agreement has been reached and the contract has been signed, the franchisee must pay any initial fee for the rights to the business. In addition, the franchisor will be paid a regular share of the profits by the franchisee, known as royalties. Royalties can be calculated from a percentage of the business turnover, a mark-up on goods supplied or a flat fee. 
For a franchise business to work properly, it has to maintain its standards and brand control. The business model must therefore be transferable, regardless of geographical location. The business activity should also be something that another business can do or be trained to do successfully. 
Evidence suggests that franchises often perform well because of the personal financial investment made by their owners and the support network provided. Once established, the franchisee has the option to buy further investments or sell their business to a buyer authorised by the franchisor. 

A disadvantage of this type of business is that the franchisee does not have any independence compared with running their own business. They have to adhere to the franchise business plan, operational plan for day-to-day running, systems, policies and procedures. Regardless of how well a franchise is managed, there is always a risk that the organisation can be tarnished by other franchisees, which could impact on future success. 


Objectives can be defined as the incremental steps a business needs to take in order to achieve its overall aims, which are often closely aligned to its business plan. 
Businesses working in different sectors vary in size and scale, therefore their aims and objectives must be individually tailored. For example, an entrepreneur who has recently started a new business may initially have an aim to financially survive the first couple of years of trading, whereas an established organisation may have an ambition to increase its annual turnover or profit. 


Objectives should be challenging, to give a business purpose and direction. Once they have been achieved, they should be updated to improve the business and move it one step closer to achieving its main goal. 
The main categories of business objective used to measure performance of an organisation in the construction industry are: 
• 
financial 

• 
social • organisational culture 

• 
innovation 

• 
quality 

• 
sustainability 

• 
compliance. 


2.1Financial objectives 
Entrepreneurs often prefer the independence associated with having control of their own organisation, rather than being employed by someone else. The freedom to run a business and make important decisions with the potential of determining successful outcomes can be personally satisfying, especially when the owner is challenged beyond their comfort zone. 
The financial objective for private organisations is usually to develop their business with innovative ideas, products or services in order to maximise profits. As the business grows, other opportunities can be created to adjust or set new goals in order to achieve a bigger market share in a particular geographical location. 
As mentioned above, the aims and objectives of businesses can be very different. For example, the financial objective of not-for-profit organisations is not to create wealth but to make enough money to: 
• 
cover their costs 

• 
establish reserves 

• 
fund activities that benefit the community 

• 
reinvest in the business. 




2.2 Social objectives 
Private organisations have social objectives to provide quality products and services that are useful to customers. 
Most private organisations serve society by employing competent people (skilled and unskilled) at different levels. Organisations with strategic social objectives to treat their employees fairly and inclusively will create meaningful jobs, which enables their businesses to grow and in turn generate further employment opportunities. These types of job often provide opportunities for continuous professional development (CPD) and promotion, as well as offering other staff benefits. Besides the fair wages that employees should receive from their employers, they may also benefit from a workplace pension or welfare schemes such as private healthcare. 
Not-for-profit organisations, such as charities and social enterprises, work for the benefit of society by providing a public service (such as housing, healthcare and education) or helping people, in order to create positive social change. 
11_06 

. Figure 11.6 Private organisations seek to provide quality products and services that are useful to customers 
2.3 Organisational culture objectives 
Organisational culture can be described as a collection of core beliefs, ethical values, expectations and behaviours that define the corporate personality of an organisation. It is embodied in the way an organisation conducts business, treats its customers, manages workflow and interacts with its employees. It is essential that all members of an organisation understand its shared cultural objectives and promote them while performing their roles and responsibilities. 
Creating a strong organisational culture is vital for the success of a company. Not only does it define a company’s internal and external identity, but it also helps to build a strong, unified team of employees who enjoy greater wellbeing. In turn, this will reduce staff turnover and assist with recruiting high-calibre employees. 
An organisation that recognises and rewards the success of its employees is likely to transform them into advocates for the business, so that they continue to promote and contribute to its consistent cultural behaviours. 

2.4Innovation objectives 
Innovation objectives involve greater levels of uncertainty and risk than general business objectives. They should be challenging but obtainable, by agreeing steps to achieve them with all the business’ shareholders. 
The primary innovation goals for business improvement can be defined by: 
• 
setting aims and developing a strategy for how these goals can be achieved 

• 
understanding the primary challenges that may prevent targets being met 

• 
understanding data, costs and risk 

• 
being able to implement innovative new ideas in the organisation 

• 
increasing employee retention 

• 
engaging with employees and promoting innovation and new ideas 

• 
identifying and rewarding talent. 



A business’ innovation objective may be to launch a new product or service, outperform its competitors or become a market leader. However, in order to accomplish these long-term goals, they may first have to achieve the following typical objectives of: • optimising existing processes or procedures 
• 
increasing business productivity and efficiency 

• 
improving the quality of service or existing products 

• 
being more competitive 

• 
meeting customers’ needs 

• 
improving the skills and knowledge of the workforce 

• 
developing performance 

• 
refining sustainability within the organisation. 


Innovative construction methods and technology, such as self-driving vehicles, virtual reality (VR), computer­controlled manufacturing robots, 3D printers and drones, are explained in Chapter 7. 

. Figure 11.7 Virtual reality is a good example of innovation in construction design and development 
2.5Quality objectives 
The minimum requirements for behaviour, work and materials in the UK construction industry are specified in health and safety legislation, British standards and building regulations. However, businesses often aim to exceed these standards, in order to ensure the welfare of their employees and offer an improved service to their clients. 
Construction businesses can subscribe to a number of voluntary assessment and certification schemes, to ensure best-practice standards that often far exceed those required by legislation. 
The Building Research Establishment’s Home Quality Mark (HQM) is an independently assessed certification scheme for new homes that focuses on the expectations and needs of occupants and protection of the environment. It assesses the quality and sustainability of the home itself, its surroundings and the construction or renovation in the following key areas, set out in the ‘Home Quality Mark ONE’ technical manual: 
• 
‘Our surroundings’, for example recreational space, local amenities and sustainable transport options 

• 
‘My home’, for example sound insulation, ventilation, water efficiency, energy and cost 

• 
‘Delivery’, for example construction energy and water use, commissioning and testing, and aftercare. 


Where the HQM scheme recognises that the standards of a new home are significantly higher than the minimum requirements, it awards a star rating from 1 to 5. A 1-star rating means that a home meets key baselines beyond minimum standards; a 5-star rating means that a home is outstanding and far exceeds minimum standards. 
Attaining the HQM instils confidence in buyers, tenants, investors, developers and insurers that higher levels of build quality have been met and there are significant benefits to living in the home, for example a lower risk of defects usually identified in new-build properties. 
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international standard-setting body with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Its membership comprises 165 national standards bodies from around the world. They work together to develop and publish market-relevant commercial, industrial and technical standards. 
The main goal of the ISO is to facilitate trade. It offers solutions to global challenges and supports innovation by providing guidelines to streamline processes and improve quality and safety across a range of businesses and products. 
There are over 23,000 ISO standards that have been voluntarily developed by industry experts by consensus, covering all aspects of manufacturing and technology. ISO identifies its certified standards with a unique reference number, for example: 
• 
ISO 45001 – Occupational health and safety management systems 

• 
ISO 9001 – Quality management systems 

• 
ISO 14001 – Environment management systems. 



Access to general ISO information can be obtained free online. However, the full guidelines must be purchased from the organisation. 
The ISO is not a governing body and does not have authority to enforce any regulations and laws. It is also not involved in the certification of its standards; this is carried out by external certification bodies. Therefore, businesses can only become certified to specific standards, for example ‘ISO 9001:2015 certified’ and not ‘ISO certified’. To become certified, a business will need to adhere to the requirements in the standards and may therefore use these as quality objectives. 

2.6Sustainability and compliance objectives 
Construction organisations often embed sustainability into their business objectives for moral reasons, for example to protect the environment by maintaining ecological balance, conserving natural resources and preventing pollution. The way we design and construct buildings plays an important part in achieving these aims, from energy-efficient construction to eco­friendly use of building materials. 
Building regulations and other external regulatory control measures determine mandatory obligations, for example Part L of the Building Regulations 2010 outlines requirements for conservation of fuel and power. However, businesses may create their own internal control measures beyond these standards and build them into their business objectives. 
Besides the moral reasons mentioned above, businesses may set further goals to improve their sustainability in order to reduce waste, increase profits and attract the interest of future clients with similar interests in protecting the environment. 



Earlier in this chapter, we acknowledged that organisational culture stems from a company’s beliefs and values, sometimes referred to as its philosophy. 
Transparent business values play an essential role in any organisation. They can: 
• 
create a sense of purpose and commitment 

• 
improve cohesion of the workforce 

• 
drive an organisation forward, helping it to reach the goals set by the management team 

• 
help motivate employees by building trust and security 

• 
help develop relationships with partners, stakeholders and customers 

• 
influence sales, customer service and marketing strategies 

• 
demonstrate the business’ culture outside of the organisation, which may attract new talent. 


It is important that potential new employees share the same values as the organisation; this will determine whether they enjoy their job, engage with the company and work productively. 


292 
The fundamental business values for construction organisations are: 
• 
financial stability 

• 
customer service 

• 
care for life 

• 
ethics and transparency 

• 
codes of conduct 

• 
collaborative working. 


3.1Financial stability 
Financial stability means a business having sufficient funds to pay overheads, repay any loans and still make a profit to prepare for risk management in times of potential economic downturn. 
A business with steady revenue that does not rely too much on debt should be making a healthy profit through sales while its expenses remain the same. This should enable growth of the business. 

3.2Customer service 
When a customer first approaches a construction business with a concept for a project, they often have expectations of what the business can provide and the level of service it should offer. To build and maintain good customer service, the business must: 
• 
pay close attention to the customer at all times 

• 
be helpful – make the customer feel at ease exchanging information and ideas 

• 
be polite and courteous when communicating verbally or in written form 

• 
listen actively to the customer by responding to all of their needs 

• 
solve problems – offer practical solutions with design, product and scheduling ideas 

• 
provide support to meet the customer’s needs and expectations 

• 
be timely – provide the product or service in a mutually acceptable timeframe 

• 
be proactive – anticipate problems before they occur 

• 
demonstrate skills and knowledge – have a strong and up-to-date understanding of the industry and be able to produce work to the highest standards 

• 
know the business product or service offered – understand the business’ limitations 


• 
ensure the customer’s needs are met – measure the success of customer service by making sure the customer’s initial expectations have been met or exceeded 

• offer value for money – be able to provide a satisfactory product or service for a reasonable price 

• 
personalise support for each customer. 


Providing good customer service is vital to the success of all construction businesses, to ensure a good reputation. Customers who experience good customer service are more likely to provide repeat business and recommend a company to other potential customers. 
3.3Care for life 
The health, safety and welfare of all employees and others affected by work activities, for example the general public, should be one of the core values of all businesses. 
Besides the legal obligations that businesses have to adhere to, they should also consider the mental and physical wellbeing of their staff and the impact that their job roles may have on them. Businesses that value their employees will make sure they have a good work­life balance and actively promote health and wellbeing through a number of different benefits, such as a tax­deductible cycle-to-work scheme or mentoring. 

. Figure 11.9 Cycle-to-work scheme 
3.4Ethics and transparency 
Business ethics can be described as business practices and policies when faced with arguably controversial subjects, for example corporate social responsibility. Some business ethics are embedded in legislation, for example employers have a duty to treat employees fairly and with respect and not to discriminate. However, ethics often goes beyond legal responsibilities to include a moral code for the business and its employees. 
Businesses with positive values and behaviours gain public trust and approval, which will enable them to grow. There are negative implications for businesses that do not have business ethics, such as damage to reputation, difficulties retaining employees and loss of work. 

Business transparency is about open and honest communication across all levels within an organisation and the sharing of information both internally and externally. 
For a business to be completely transparent, it must provide access to all the information needed, not just what it is willing to share. Some businesses may not want information such as salaries, revenue, future ambitions and hiring policies to be available to the public, although this level of transparency can provide potential investors and customers with an insight into the organisation and the level of service they can expect. 
When employees feel financially, physically and emotionally safe within an organisation, they are more likely to communicate openly and honestly with their employers, without fear of losing their job. In turn, when employees feel they are being listened to, they are more motivated and productive. 

. Figure 11.10 Employees who can communicate openly and honestly with their employers are more motivated and productive 
3.5Codes of conduct 
A code of conduct is essentially a set of rules written by an employer for their employees, in order to protect their business and its reputation. It should explain an organisation’s values and principles and link them with standards of professional behaviour. 
293 

A code of conduct typically includes standards of behaviour regarding equality and diversity, protection of sensitive data, and disclosure of any criminal convictions that an employee may have prior to employment or during their service. 
All employees must read and understand their employer’s code of conduct before starting work; they must also appreciate the consequences of not following the rules. Any breaches of the code of conduct could result in disciplinary action being taken, or in some cases termination of employment. 
3.6Collaborative working 
Internal collaborative working enables a diverse range of employees with specific skills or traits to work together to problem solve and achieve business objectives. 
Collaborative working with another organisation is referred to as networking. Organisations of different sizes can collaborate in a non-hierarchical way either in person or remotely using a variety of different technologies, for example video conferencing and BIM. 
Besides being more competitive, there are several other advantages of working with another organisation, including: 
• 
sharing responsibilities 

• 
sharing knowledge and expertise 

• 
sharing materials, resources and facilities 

• 
developing skills and innovation 

• 
improving motivation 

• 
increasing productivity and sales 

• 
accelerating business growth 

• 
being able to tender for larger contracts 

• 
achieving aims that may have been out of reach if working independently. 


Provided that employees understand and share the same business values, and their employer honours them when making important decisions, a strong business can be created with a positive company image. 




Construction and maintenance of the built environment can have a negative impact on the natural environment and local communities, through pollution and disruption. Employees in the construction industry can also experience short- and long-term physical and mental health issues due to a number of factors, for example working to time constraints in a competitive market. 
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the commitment of an organisation to carry out its business activities in a socially and environmentally responsible way. 

Principles of CSR  Application in the construction industry  
Construction design  • Ensuring buildings are well designed to suit occupants’ lifestyles • Being guided by the local community to meet its needs (for example providing functional community spaces, landscaping, cycle paths, community lighting for safety) • Ensuring inclusivity (for example providing affordable homes) • Improving quality of life and wellbeing  
Social, economic and environmental considerations in construction design and planning  • Supporting housing initiatives • Supporting training and development programmes, for example work experience, apprenticeships and internships • Boosting the economy by increasing local employment and paying above the minimum living wage • Encouraging flexible working • Improving working conditions for employees • Ensuring equality and diversity in the workforce by creating opportunities for minority and underrepresented groups • Supporting local community groups and charitable activities with time and resources • Reducing the environmental impact of construction work  
Sustainable construction  • Using ethically and sustainably sourced building materials through the entire supply chain, for example Forest Stewardship Council certified timber • Using recycled materials • Minimising waste • Using local trades, suppliers and materials • Constructing greener buildings using low-impact materials • Working more efficiently to reduce carbon footprint • Reducing the use of fossil fuels • Reducing air, water and ground pollution • Making provision to improve the biodiversity of the local area • Providing energy-efficiency initiatives  

CSR is not a legal requirement. However, developing a CSR strategy that will have a positive impact on the community and wider society, and integrating it into an organisation’s values, makes good business sense, because it often contributes to risk management and legal compliance. It also affects how stakeholders such 
. Table 11.1 CSR in the construction industry 


as clients and investors view an organisation, and may impact on their decision to work with or support it. 
It is important for construction businesses to establish links with local schools, community groups and charities, with a view to being as transparent as possible about their aims to both minimise negative impacts on the community and actively make positive impacts. 
Table 11.1 provides examples of how CSR is applied in the construction industry. 
. Figure 11.12 Supporting training and development programmes such as apprenticeships is an important part of CSR 
Besides the moral obligations businesses have to protect the environment and people from construction activities, there are also legal duties that may align with their CSR commitments. Failure to follow legal duties can result in prosecution and damaged public relations. 
Further information on CSR can be found in Chapter 3. 


As mentioned above, an entrepreneur is an individual who starts up their own business, taking on financial risk in the hope of making a profit. To be successful, a business owner must know their market well, including its strengths and weaknesses, in order to provide a service or product for which there is a demand or that has a unique selling point (USP). 
5.1 Creating a viable product or service 
Market research is a valuable tool used by many businesses to analyse industry and demographic data, in order to gather information about consumer needs and preferences. 
Typical data that a business may want to analyse in a particular location or region could include: 
• 
age 

• 
gender 

• 
marital status 

• 
education 

• 
employment 

• 
income. 


The data gathered will help to create two different groups of people: those with no interest in the business and a possible customer base. 
Once a viable business opportunity has been identified, the business’ mission should be established – what does the business hope to achieve? A business’ goals could be purely economic or financial, although some businesses are created for social or environmental reasons. 


296 
Entrepreneurs who are willing to take a risk, and have the vision to solve problems with an innovative product or service, are likely to have a successful enterprise. Besides developing the initial business concept, they are also the driving force behind an organisation, and must therefore have other qualities in order to grow their business. They must be confident in their product or service and motivated by the business model, not just by the idea of generating a lot of money. 
Developing innovative technologies, products and processes is extremely important to the future of the construction sector, in order to: 
• 
create employment 

• 
improve productivity 

• 
provide value for money 

• 
improve the way we live 

• 
improve product service 

• 
increase growth and profit 

• 
make advancements in the industry. 



5.2 Capital 
To get a new business venture off the ground often requires an investment known as working capital. This is a sum of money remaining after all the business’ debts have been covered. It does not amount to the value of the company in terms of assets or customer’s unpaid bills. 
The money needed to start a business could come from the owner/s, investors, shareholders or a business loan. Business loans from banks are often secured against the owner’s personal assets or those of the business, depending on the type of organisation. (See section 1 of this chapter for details on different types of organisations.) 
Chapter 11 Construction commercial/business principles 


5.3 Growth and marketing 
For a business to thrive, potential customers need to be made aware of the product or service being sold, the people selling it, the price and the place where they can buy it. Therefore, some of the money invested in a business should be allocated to promoting the product or service through marketing. Active advertising will communicate with a bigger audience more quickly than waiting for the business to grow through word of mouth alone. 
Before a customer decides to invest their money in a product or service, they may want evidence that it is as good as it sounds. As a business begins to grow, it can build customer confidence by sharing evidence of its success through showcasing satisfied customers or completed projects 


5.4Priorities 
Entrepreneurs with a concept for a new business must have a list of priorities to get their venture off the ground, become financially stable as soon as possible, and grow in the future. Even with a strong initial investment, a business will need to earn money quickly to repay any loans it may have for resources and equipment and to cover the cost of overheads and wages. 
Below are some of the general priorities an entrepreneur should have when they start a business: 
• 
Develop a concept or product. 

• 
Research the market. 

• 
Produce a business plan, including business aims and objectives. 

• 
Seek investment. 

• 
Produce business documentation, for example a contract of employment, code of conduct and health and safety policy. 

• 
Acquire premises, such as an office, workshop or factory. 

• 
Acquire resources, such as machinery, equipment and staff. 

• 
Register the business. 

• 
Arrange suitable insurance for the business. 

• 
Market/advertise the business, for example by networking. 

• 
Ensure the business income is more than its outgoings. 

• 
Regularly measure performance against benchmarks (covered later in this chapter). 

• 
Set improvement strategies to meet targets. 

• 
Keep accurate business accounts. 

• 
Submit annual tax returns and pay any duty due. 


It is important to acknowledge that just as many entrepreneurs fail as succeed. However, there are many more who never progress beyond their initial idea because of the fear of failure. Entrepreneurs with a passion about something important to them, who have patience, confidence and tenacity, are most likely to achieve their goals. 

6.1Benchmarking 
Successful organisations regularly evaluate their performance and make improvements, either to tackle areas of weakness or to demonstrate excellence. 
Many new businesses fail within the first few years of trading because they cannot manage their cash flow effectively. The concepts for the business may be sound, and there may be no shortage of work, but if the business is poorly managed then the money goes out quicker than it comes in. 
The term ‘benchmarking’ means measuring an organisation’s internal and external performance against pre-determined industry standards, competitors or completed projects. It is a powerful management tool that can increase both productivity and profits with minimum input (time and money) and maximum output (benefits). Any business targets set by an organisation must be realistic and achievable, if the business is to accomplish its aims. 

6.2SMART objectives 
SMART is a common acronym used in the built environment and construction industry for target setting. Smart objectives must be: 
• 
Specific – clear, unambiguous and understood by those who are expected to achieve them 

• 
Measurable – in terms of time, productivity or cost 

• 
Achievable – in terms of the size of the organisation, resources available and budget 

• 
Relevant – appropriate to what is being done 

• 
Time-bound – in terms of a start and finish date (objectives with no deadline for completion are usually dismissed and never achieved). 



6.3 Key performance indicators (KPIs) 
Benchmarking is a recognised system that involves identifying problem areas in a business that need improvement, for example: 
• 
project completion times 

• 
planned budgets against actual costs 

• 
profit margins. 


Areas that can be measured in terms of a value are known as key performance indicators (KPIs). Measuring business performance against KPIs helps to establish if objectives have been met or whether new strategic targets need to be planned. If a business is not honest with the findings of KPIs, fails to learn from its mistakes and starts the cycle again, then the process of benchmarking is pointless. 

. Figure 11.15 The process of benchmarking 
Every business selects its own KPIs based on what is important to it. For example, they could be used to measure the performance of a construction project based on data from a similar completed project. By looking at the results, a business can establish what worked well, as well as what worked less well, and find areas for improvement (for example when scheduling and sequencing work). 

Gathering information for benchmarking within an organisation is much easier than trying to measure the success of a business against its competitors, because of difficulties in accessing all of the data needed. Internal benchmarking is often more valuable than external benchmarking, because it is focused and can be tailored to meet specific business objectives. 
External benchmarking is used by businesses and other organisations such as the government to focus on the industry as a whole. Construction industry KPIs can be gathered from the results of national surveys of clients and construction professionals and performance data based on thousands of projects across the UK. Glenigan and Constructing Excellence publish annual sets of KPIs with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, to support businesses and drive improvement.

1.1Air-conditioning systems 

Air-conditioning (AC) systems are used in both 


domestic and commercial properties to improve the 

comfort of occupants. They work by using the vapour­compression refrigeration cycle. 



. Figure 12.1 An air-conditioning system 
Refrigerants are fluorinated chemicals that are used 
in both liquid and gas states. They can, therefore, be classified as both liquid (when compressed) and gas (vapour). All refrigerants boil at extremely low temperatures, well below 0°C. When a refrigerant gas is compressed, it changes state to a liquid. During this process, a lot of heat and pressure is 
created. When the pressure is released quickly, it 


Types of air-conditioning system 
generates cold. 
During the vapour-compression refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapour enters a compressor, which compresses it, generating heat. The compressed vapour then enters a condenser, where the useful heat is removed and the vapour condenses to a liquid refrigerant. From here, the liquid refrigerant passes through an expansion valve, where rapid expansion takes place. The warm liquid is converted to a super-cold vapour/liquid mix, which creates the refrigeration effect. The vapour/liquid mix passes through an evaporator, where final expansion to a vapour takes place. This vapour then enters the compressor for the cycle to begin again. 
The ability of refrigerants to change their state quickly with such wide temperature changes allows them to be used in refrigeration plants, air-conditioning systems and heat pumps. 


Ducted systems 
Ducted air-conditioning systems pump cooled air from a central cooling unit through a series of ducts which terminate in vents. 
Components of a ducted system include: 
• 
a circulation fan (fan coil unit), which moves air to and from rooms 

• 
an air-conditioning unit, which uses cooling and dehumidification processes in summer or heating and humidification processes in winter 

• 
supply ducts, which direct conditioned air from the circulating fan to the space to be air-conditioned 

• 
an air diffuser, which distributes the conditioned air evenly in the room 

• 
return air grilles, which allow air to enter the return duct 

• 
filters, which remove dust and bacteria from the air. 



Split systems 
Split-system air conditioners consist of inner and outer 


units connected by pipes, allowing refrigerant to flow to and from each unit. They can be fitted with a heat pump, ensuring they can be used all year round by providing both cool and warm air. 
Single-split systems consist of an outdoor unit for every indoor unit. Multi-split systems allow numerous indoor units to be connected to a single, larger outdoor unit. 

Variable refrigerant flow systems 
Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems are air-cooled and refrigerant-based, using outdoor condenser units and indoor fan coil units in the same way as more traditional air-conditioning systems. However, instead of one large unit pumping air to the whole space, a VRF system incorporates several smaller air handlers which can be controlled individually and piped back to one system. 
1.2 Electrotechnical systems 


Electrotechnical systems carry, distribute and convert electrical power in a property for use in: 
• 
socket outlets for appliances with a 3 A or 13 A three-pin plug 

• 
fixed appliances, such as cookers, showers and immersion heaters 

• 
lighting systems 

• 
protection services, such as intruder alarms, surveillance systems, fire alarms and access controls 

• 
refrigeration and ventilation systems 

• 
telecommunication systems, such as telephones, internet, home entertainment and connections for other BSE systems 

• 
heating systems, such as gas boilers, electrical wall heaters and fan convectors. 




6 A lighting 1.5 mm2 6242Y 

Lighting 
Lighting circuits are generally rated at 6 A but can, in some installations, be rated at 10 A or 16 A. The ratings are based on calculation of the number of lights and the type of lights included in the circuit. Consideration must be given to the type of lighting point used for higher-rated circuits. 
Lighting circuits are intended to supply lighting points, but in some cases they may also supply small power electrical equipment, such as bathroom fans and shaver supply units. 
Lighting circuits can be wired in different ways: 
• 
three-plate – commonly used in domestic properties for circuits wired in composite cable, such as thermosetting insulated and sheathed flat-profile cable 

• 
conduit method – used for circuits wired in single­core cables within a suitable containment system. 





Power 
Power circuits generally supply socket outlets but may also supply individual appliances. They may be wired in two ways: 
• 
ring final 

• 
radial. 


Ring final circuits provide socket outlets for appliances and are protected at the consumer unit with a 30 A or 32 A miniature circuit breaker (MCB). They should not exceed an area of 100 m² in domestic installations. The phase, neutral and circuit protective conductors (CPCs) are connected to their dedicated terminals at the consumer unit and then form a ring circuit by looping in and out of the respective terminals at the back of the sockets, eventually returning to the point from where they began. There is no limit to the number of sockets that can be installed on a ring final circuit if proper design considerations are adhered to. Kitchens and utility rooms may require their own dedicated circuits. 

. Figure 12.4 Ring final circuit showing spurs 


Radial circuits may be used to supply multiple socket outlets. They do not return to the consumer unit (unlike ring final circuits) and are protected at the consumer unit with a 20 A MCB. 
Supply 
Branch 

. Figure 12.5 Radial circuit showing branch 
Heating and appliances 
Radial circuits can supply individual appliances or dedicated fixed-appliance circuits, such as boilers, immersion heaters, cookers and showers. They can have any rating, depending on the cable size, but typical ratings for heating appliances include: 
• 
16 A for dedicated boiler circuits 

• 
16 A for immersion heaters 

• 
32 A for cooker installations. 


Electric showers are rated between 7 and 10.5 kW. This means that a 10.5 kW shower requires a 45 A electrical circuit to supply it. 
Data and control 
Data cabling is cabling within a building installed to support multiple hardware systems, such as: 
• 
telephones 

• 
internet and television 

• 
CCTV 

• 
music servers 

• 
printers 

• 
VoIP systems. 



The system contains all the wiring to transmit data around the building from routers and data cabinets to individual data points. Care must be taken when installing data and control cabling within a building to prevent crosstalk. 


. Figure 12.7 Data cable panel 
1.3Gas systems 
Gas systems supply gas to a property as a source of fuel for heating and cooking. 
There are two different types of gas: 
• 
Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture, consisting primarily of methane. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. 

• 
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a by-product of crude oil. It was developed with the compactness and portability of a liquid but can be readily used as a gas. It is mainly associated with leisure applications but also used in homes where no natural gas supply is available. 




known as the transmission and distribution network. The gas passes through several pressure-reduction tiers in preparation for entry to properties. 
Components of a gas system include: 
• 
an emergency control valve, which isolates the gas supply 

• 
a meter governor, which reduces/regulates the incoming gas pressure 

• 
a meter, which measures the amount of gas used for billing purposes 

• 
installation pipework, which supplies gas to all appliances in a property. 



Gas installation pipework must be adequately sized to meet the requirements of the appliances it serves. A typical small domestic installation has 22 mm pipework from the meter supplying appliances. 


. Figure 12.8 Gas supply to a property 
Gas boilers 
Gas boilers are the most popular of all central-heating appliances. Over the years, there have been many different types, from large, multi-sectional, cast­iron domestic boilers to small, low-water-content condensing types. 
Boilers that can be used with wet central-heating systems fall into distinct categories: 
• Traditional boilers do not contain any form of expansion vessel or operational controls, such as a pump or filling loop. 
. Table 12.1 Types of gas boiler 

• 
A condensing traditional boiler does not give instantaneous hot water. It must be installed in conjunction with a hot water storage system and heating system. It contains an expansion vessel, filling loop and pressure-relief valve, and does not require a feed and expansion cistern. 

• 
Condensing boilers work by extracting heat from flue gases produced when natural gas is combusted (CO2, nitrogen and water vapour). These flue gases pass over two heat exchangers: the primary heat exchanger extracts about 80 per cent of the heat from the gases and the secondary heat exchanger extracts a further 12–14 per cent of the heat. In the secondary heat exchanger, the water vapour in the flue gases condenses to form water droplets, which are collected in a condensate trap before falling to drain via a condensate pipe. Condensing boilers produce a distinctive ‘plume’ of water vapour during operation. 

• 
System boilers have all the necessary safety and operational controls fitted directly to them. There is no need for a separate expansion vessel, pressure­relief valve or filling loop, and this makes the installation much simpler. 

• 
Combination boilers provide central heating and instantaneous hot-water supply from a single appliance. Modern combination boilers are very efficient and contain all the safety controls (i.e. expansion vessel and pressure-relief valve) of a sealed system.

All central-heating appliances require a flue to remove the products of combustion (POC) safely to the outside. The basic concept is to produce an updraught, whether by natural means or using a fan, to eject fumes away from the building. There are two types of flue system: .open .room-sealed. 
An open flue system is the simplest. Because heat rises, it relies on the heat of the flue gases to create an updraught. There are two different types, natural draught and forced draught. 
An open flue is made up of four components: 
.
 primary flue: creates the initial pull to clear the products of combustion 

.
 draught diverter: draws air in to dilute the products of combustion 

.
 secondary flue: carries the flue gases to the terminal 

.
 terminal: allows the flue gases to evacuate to the atmosphere. 


Natural-draught systems take the POC from within the room where the appliance is sited and expel them through the flue terminal using the draught created by the different densities of the flue gases and the colder air outside. There is no fan in this type of system. 

Room-sealed flue systems draw air for combustion directly from the outside through the same flue assembly used to discharge the POC. They are safer than open-flue systems, since there is no direct route for the POC to spill back into the room. There are two basic types: natural draught and forced draught (fan-assisted).

Gas fires 
Gas fires are space-heating appliances used to heat the rooms in which they are installed. There is a wide range of fires available, with different flue options: 
• 
Flueless (type A): this type of appliance is not intended for connection to a flue or any device for evacuating the POC outside the room in which the appliance is installed. The air for combustion is taken from the room, and the POC are released into the room. 

• 
Open-flue (type B): this type of appliance is intended to be connected to a flue that evacuates the POC outside the room containing the appliance. The air for combustion is taken from the room via a series of vents. 

• 
Room-sealed (type C): the air supply, combustion chamber, heat exchanger and evacuation of POC for this type of appliance are sealed with respect to the room in which the appliance is installed. 

Types of gas fire include: 

• 
radiant convector: a type of fire which relies on ceramics near the burner to radiate heat into the room. 

• 
inset live fuel effect (ILFE): a type of fire which is sealed to the builder’s opening within the chimney of a building. Heat is radiated from the fuel bed and produced by convection through the heat exchanger. 

• 
decorative fuel effect (DFE): a type of fire which incorporates radiants which are made to look like coal, wood or stone placed inside or underneath an open chimney. 

• 
flueless catalytic: a type of fire which is not connected to a chimney or flue system. Products of combustion are discharged directly into the room.

Freestanding cookers rest directly on the floor and comprise a hotplate with one or more burners, one or more ovens with or without thermostats, and possibly a grill and/or griddle. 

• 
Grills cook food by means of radiant heat. They can be an integral part of a freestanding cooker or individual appliances. 

• 
Hobs (hotplates) comprise one or more covered/ uncovered burners designed to support cooking vessels. 

• 
Ovens are closed compartments for roasting and baking food. 



1.4Heating systems 
Central-heating systems distribute warmth throughout the whole or part of a building from a single heat source (the boiler), for the thermal comfort of the occupants. Boilers can be fuelled by coal, gas, oil or electricity; they transfer their heat energy to another medium, usually water or air, which carries the heat to the areas where it is needed. Water-based systems are known as wet systems, while air- or electric-based systems are referred to as dry systems. 
There is no standard heating system; all systems are tailored to suit the individual installation requirements, such as property type, property construction and fuel availability. 



Domestic heating systems 
Domestic wet central-heating systems contain several components: 
• 
heat source (boiler/heater) 

• 
heat emitters (radiators/underfloor heating circuits) 

• 
thermostats for temperature control 

• 
time control to set on/off periods. 



There are three categories of central-heating system: 
• 
Full central heating provides heating in all rooms to a comfortable temperature. 

• 
Background heating heats the property to a lower temperature than full central heating. 

• 
Selective heating heats only parts of the property as required. 



Heating systems fall into two different categories, based on the way the system is filled with water and the pressure at which it operates: 
• 
Low-pressure, open-vented central-heating systems are supplied by a feed and expansion cistern located in the roof space, or in a tank room in a commercial property. They can be modern, fully-pumped systems or existing semi-gravity systems. 

• 
Sealed, pressurised central-heating systems are fed directly from the mains cold-water supply and incorporate an expansion vessel to take up the expansion of water as it is heated. A filling loop is required to charge the central-heating system with water. 


As mentioned above, combination boilers provide both central heating and instantaneous hot-water supply from a single appliance. They contain all the safety controls of a sealed system. 

This system uses a single three-port motorised mid-position valve to control  
the flow of water to the central heating circuit and the hot water circuit.

Industrial/commercial electric boilers are compact, electrically powered heating devices designed for commercial and industrial buildings. They are connected to a three-phase, 400 V electricity supply. They heat water, which is pumped around the building, giving off its heat via heat emitters. 
Warm-air heaters are also commonly used in industrial and commercial buildings. They are designed to be installed to heat the whole space. Alternatively, radiant tube heaters may be used to heat a specific zone of the building and are usually supplied by natural gas.

1.5 Plumbing systems 
Cold-water systems 
Cold-water systems provide fresh, wholesome water to properties. This water can be used directly from the water main for cooking and drinking purposes or can be stored for use within other systems, for example to flush toilets or to supply hot-water and central-heating systems. 
There are two different types of water supply to a property: 
.
 Private water supplies are covered by the Private Water Supplies (England) Regulations 2016. The water is sourced close to the property from streams, rivers, natural springs or boreholes. It is supplied to the property via a pump and treated to ensure it is safe for drinking and hygiene purposes. 

.
 Public/municipal water supplies come from the water undertaker’s main. They are covered by the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999. 


Key term 
Wholesome water: water that is fit to use for drinking, cooking, food preparation or washing without danger to human health

The collection, treatment and supply of wholesome • The service pipe is owned and maintained by the water to consumers is the responsibility of the water owner of the building. It must be installed at a undertakers. The water is supplied to homes via a grid-minimum depth of 750 mm and a maximum depth system network of pipes which runs underneath the roads. of 1350 mm. The connection between the mains water supply and a dwelling is made via a ferrule, which removes the need to isolate the supply. 
The water supply from the water main into the building comprises two separate pipes: 
• The communication pipe is owned and maintained by the water undertaker and leads to the boundary stop tap. 



. Figure 12.19 Public water supply to a building 



Direct cold-water systems 
In a direct cold-water system, all cold-water taps are fed directly from the mains supply. This means that all taps are provided with wholesome water. Storage is only required for supplying cold water to the hot­water system via a cistern where an instantaneous hot-water heater or combi boiler is not fitted. This system is designed to be used in areas with high water pressure. 
. Table 12.2 Advantages and disadvantages of direct cold-water systems 
Advantages  Disadvantages  
• Cheaper to install • Drinking water at all terminal fittings • Less pipework • Less structural support required in roof space for the cold-feed cistern • More suitable for instantaneous showers, hose taps and mixer fittings • Used in conjunction with a high-pressure (unvented) hot­water supply • Smaller pipe sizes may be used in most cases • Good pressure at all cold-water outlets  • Pressure may drop at times of peak demand • Property has no water if the mains are under repair • Any leak in the premises will cause a great deal of damage due to high pressure • Can be noisy • Greater risk of contamination to mains • Greater wear on taps and valves • More problems with water hammer • Greater risk of condensation build-up on the pipework  





Indirect cold-water systems 
In an indirect cold-water system, only wholesome water outlets such as kitchen sinks are fed directly from the mains cold-water supply. The other outlets are fed indirectly via a cold-water storage cistern in the roof space. This system is designed to be used in areas with low water pressure, where the mains-supply pipework is not capable of supplying the full requirement of the system. 

In larger buildings, such as office blocks, factories and hotels, it is preferable for all water except drinking water to be supplied indirectly via a protected storage cistern. This ensures there is a backup supply of water to flush toilets and provides hot water services in the event of disruption to the mains supply. 




Boosted cold-water systems 
Typical mains water pressure is between 3 and 7 bar. Multi-storey buildings are too tall to be supplied using this pressure and, after taking into consideration frictional loss when pipe sizing, it may be necessary to boost their cold-water supply. 
There are several types of boosted cold-water (BCW) system: 
• 
Direct boosted: water is boosted directly from the undertaker’s main to a cold-water storage cistern at the upper level. 

• 
Direct boosted with drinking-water header: water is boosted directly from the undertaker’s main to a cold-water storage cistern and drinking-water header. 

• 
Indirect boosted to a storage cistern: water is boosted from a break cistern with water supplied from the undertaker’s main to a cold-water storage cistern at the upper level. 

• 
Indirect boosted with a pressure vessel: water is boosted from a break cistern with water supplied from the undertaker’s main to individual cold-water storage cisterns on various floors. 



. Table 12.3 Advantages and disadvantages of indirect cold-water systems 
Advantages  Disadvantages  
• Reduced risk of water hammer and noise • Constant low-pressure supply reduces risk and rate of leakage • Suitable for supply to mixer fittings for vented hot-water supply • Reserve supply of water available in case of mains failure • Less risk of backflow – fewer fittings supplied directly • Showers may be supplied at equal head of pressure • Reduces demand on main at peak periods • Can be sized to give greater flow rate  • Supply pipe must be protected against backflow from cistern • Risk of frost damage in the roof space • Structural support needed for the cistern • Space taken up in the roof space • Increased cost of installation • Reduced pressure at terminal fittings  

Automatic air inlet valve 


Hot-water systems 
Hot-water systems are used for both personal hygiene and for cleaning purposes. They should provide an adequate flow of water at the correct temperature required by the users of the building. 
Water can be heated in a property by: 
• 
burning fossil fuels (coal, oil or gas) 

• 
using electricity 

• 
using a solar thermal system. 



There are two categories of hot-water system: 
• centralised, where hot water is supplied from a 
. Figure 12.22 Direct boosting to a drinking-water central source within the building and supplies header and duplicate cisterns 
several outlets throughout the building 


• localised, where the hot water is heated and supplied at the point of use. 
These systems can be divided into two further categories: 
• 
storage, where hot water is stored at temperature in a vessel/cylinder 

• 
instantaneous, where water is heated on demand. 



Building Services Engineering for Construction T Level: Core 



Centralised hot-water systems 
Open-vented hot-water storage systems are heated by either a boiler or an electric immersion heater. Water is stored in a hot-water cylinder, which is fed from a cold-water storage cistern. Hot-water outlets are supplied via a system of copper or plastic pipework, sized at a minimum of 15 mm. The system contains an open vent pipe, which acts as a safety relief in the event of overheating. Water is stored at 60–65°C and should be distributed at no less than 55°C. 

There are two types of open-vented hot-water system: 
• 
direct, which contains no form of heat exchanger 

• 
indirect, which contains a heat exchanger to heat up the secondary water.

Combination storage systems are vented hot-water systems with the cold-water storage cistern, cylinder and associated pipework combined in one unit. They come in a variety of storage capacities and, as with vented hot­water cylinders, are available in both direct and indirect models. They are ideal for properties that require stored hot water but have no loft space. Care needs to be taken when siting these units due to the low static head resulting in poor flow rates out of the taps.

Unvented hot-water storage systems are heated by either a boiler or an electric immersion heater. Water is stored in a hot-water cylinder, which is fed directly from the cold-water mains. Hot-water outlets are supplied via a system of copper or plastic pipework, sized at a minimum of 15 mm. The system contains an open vent pipe, which acts as a safety relief in the event of overheating. Water is stored at 60–65°C and should be distributed at no less than 55°C. 
This system contains several components to ensure both correct operation and safety for the user: 
• 
line strainer: filters the water supply to protect system components 

• 
pressure-reducing valve: reduces the mains water pressure 

• 
single-check valve: prevents backflow 

• 
expansion-relief valve: discharges water to a safe place in the event of an increase in system pressure 

• 
temperature-relief valve: discharges water to a safe place in the event of an increase in system temperature 

• 
expansion vessel: takes up the expansion of water within the system during operation.

Secondary circulation Secondary circulation prevents the wastage of water due to excessive lengths of hot-water draw-off from the storage vessel to the outlet. It is a method of returning the hot-water draw-off back to the storage cylinder in a continuous loop, to eliminate cold-water ‘dead legs’ by reducing the distance the hot water must travel before it arrives at the taps. In all installations, secondary circulation incorporates a bronze- or stainless-steel­bodied circulating pump to circulate the water to and from the storage cylinder. 



. Figure 12.31 Secondary circulation 


Localised hot-water systems 
Cistern-type water heaters are designed to be connected directly to the rising main and allow hot water to be supplied to several outlets. The unit contains the cold-water storage cistern and an integral heater chamber, which is heated by an electric immersion heater controlled by a thermostat. 
Cold water supply 

. Figure 12.32 Cistern-type water heater 
Instantaneous water heaters can be fuelled by either gas or electricity and are generally described as inlet controlled (the water supply is controlled at the inlet to the heater). The water is heated as it flows through the heater and will continue to be heated as long as the water is flowing. When the control valve is closed, the water flow stops and the heat source shuts down. 
323 

This type of heater is generally used to supply small the kW output, the better the overall flow rate at a quantities of hot water, such as for washbasins and showering temperature.

Storage-type localised water heaters are often referred to as displacement heaters, as the hot water is displaced from the heater by cold water entering the unit. Typical storage capacities are between 7 and 10 litres. 
As the name suggests, over-sink heaters are fitted over a sink. The water is heated by an electric heater element and delivered from a spout on the heater. 
Under-sink heaters are fitted under the sink and work in the same way as over-sink heaters. The main difference is that they usually require a special tap or mixer tap that permits the outlet to be open to the atmosphere at all times, to allow for expansion. The inlet of water to the heater is still controlled from the tap. Typical capacities are up to 15 litres.

Sanitation systems 
Sanitation systems take waste solids and liquids away from a building, to ensure hygienic conditions are maintained within. This includes waste from toilets, baths, basins, sinks, bidets and showers. 

Sanitation-system pipework comprises two sections: 
• 
The soil pipe, also known as the soil stack, is the lower, wet part of the system that takes effluent away from a building. 

• 
The vent pipe, also known as the vent stack, is the upper part of the system that introduces air to help prevent loss of trap seal. 


Together, these pipes are known as a stack system. 

Primary ventilated stack system 
The primary ventilated stack is the most common system found in domestic properties. It is used where appliances are grouped closely around the stack. 
Secondary ventilated stack system 
The secondary ventilated stack system is installed to prevent positive and negative pressure fluctuations. It is used where appliances are grouped closely around the stack. 

Ventilated branch discharge system 
The ventilated branch discharge system is commonly used in commercial and industrial premises, where appliances are installed in ranges and sited a distance away from the stack. It ensures compliance with building regulations in relation to maximum permitted branch pipework lengths. 

A: WC branch 
B: Washbasin and bidet 
C: Washing machine/dishwasher 
D: Bath 
E: Kitchen/utility sink 
. 
Figure 12.37 Primary ventilated stack system 

. Figure 12.38 Secondary ventilated stack system 

. 
Figure 12.39 Ventilated branch discharge system 





Stub stack system 
A stub stack system can be used where sanitary appliances are connected directly to an internal drain. This reduces the need for ventilation pipework and removes the requirement for the soil system to penetrate the building structure. 

d (single appliance) = 6 m max. d (group of appliances)  = 12 m max. 
. Figure 12.40 Stub stack system 
When installing a stub stack: 
• 
the stack should be terminated with an air admittance valve 

• 
the maximum distance between the invert of the drain and the base of a WC should be 1.3 m 

• 
the maximum distance between the invert of the drain and the highest branch connection should be 2 m. 



The type of trap used will depend on the appliance it is connected to, and examples include: 
• 
P traps and S traps: these are types of swivel trap which are used on new work and appliance replacements 

• 
running traps: these are used for a range of appliances. Rather than individual traps on each appliance, a single running trap can be used at the end of a pipework run 

• 
bottle traps: used on washbasins because of their neat appearance; shower traps are a combined waste and trap allowing the trap to be cleaned of potential blockages, such as hair, from the top of the waste on the shower tray 

• 
washing machine traps: used for appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers, they are generally of P-trap configuration, with an extended neck to accommodate a washing machine/ dishwasher outlet hose 

• 
in-line traps: designed with washbasins in mind, an in-line trap is essentially an S trap where the inlet and outlet are in line 

• 
anti-vac traps: use a small air admittance valve located after the water seal 

• 
self-sealing traps: waterless valves that use a thin neoprene rubber membrane to create an airtight seal, preventing foul air from entering the dwelling while maintaining equal pressure within the soil and vent system. 


Trap size is dependent on the size of an appliance’s waste/soil pipe.

Rainwater systems 
Rainwater systems collect and carry away rain from roofs using either integrated channels or eaves­mounted gutters connected to rainwater pipes. The water is discharged into surface-water drains, combined sewers, soakaways or water courses such as 
Gutter 
streams and rivers. 


Off-set bend 
Building features determine the type of gutter bracket used to secure a gutter. For example: 
• 
when fascia boards are fitted, fascia brackets are used 

• 
when no fascia boards are fitted and the rafters are exposed, rafter brackets are used 

• 
when no fascia boards are fitted and no rafters are exposed, rise and fall brackets which are directly fixed into the masonry are used. 

The purpose of a rainwater system is to: 

• 
protect the foundations of the building 

• 
reduce ground erosion 

• 
prevent damp and water penetration of the building. 


It can also be used as part of a rainwater-harvesting system.

Gravity rainwater systems typically use PVC-U, extruded-aluminium or cast-iron gutters: 
• 
PVC-U gutters use a snap-fit system that allows them to click together. They are sealed with integral rubber. 

• 
Extruded-aluminium gutters are jointed in the middle and secured with screws or rivets. 

• 
Cast-iron gutters are jointed in the middle and bolted together with gutter bolts. 



1.6 Protection systems 
Protection systems are designed to safeguard a property, its occupants and its contents against intruders and fire. They can also provide surveillance of the building and its surrounding area and provide access control. 
Intruder alarm systems 
There are many different types of modern intruder alarm, with a range of components and functions available. The type chosen will depend on the building being protected and the level of security required. 

332 
Before installing an intruder alarm, a survey should be carried out to ensure it is appropriate for the level of risk and meets the requirements of the client. A system design proposal should then be produced that lists the equipment to be installed and its location. 

Types of intruder alarm system 
Audible intruder alarm systems 
This is the most basic type of intruder alarm. When the alarm is triggered, a loud sound alerts people that an intruder has entered or is trying to enter the property. 
This type of alarm system is suitable for most domestic dwellings, depending on several factors: 
• 
location of the property: is the property remote or located in a public area? 

• 
property use: for example a bank would require a higher level of protection 

• 
contents of the property: for example a building with expensive ICT equipment would require a higher level of security. 


Remotely monitored intruder alarm systems 
When this type of alarm is triggered, it can provide notification of the intrusion to: 
• 
a remote monitoring centre 

• 
a building owner 

• 
the police. 


It usually also incorporates an audible alarm. 
Intruder alarm system components 
Intruder alarm systems consist of three main components: 
• 
control unit 

• 
detection device 

• 
audible warning device. 


Control unit 
The control unit operates on mains-derived 230 V AC electricity, with the alarm circuits and wiring using 12 V. The system should be fitted with a standby, rechargeable battery to provide power in the event of disruption to the mains power supply. 
The control panel can be programmed to perform a range of tasks, from switching the system on and off to altering the system configuration and timers. Some systems also allow selective parts to be activated. 
The keypad is usually located in a convenient position to allow the user to operate the alarm system, rather than being fitted to the control panel. 
For remotely monitored systems, connection to an ethernet or Wi-Fi communicator is required. The system is connected using PVC-insulated and PVC-sheathed multi-core alarm cable, with the communications connected using Cat 5/6 data cable. 

Detection device 
Detection devices detect the presence of an intruder and signal the information to the control unit: 
• 
Door contacts comprise a magnetic reed switch fitted in a door frame with a magnet sited alongside it in the door. When the door is opened, the magnetic field is removed from the area of the reed switch, which generates an alarm signal. 

• 
Passive infrared (PIR) sensors can be mounted in a room to detect movement in their field of view. 

• 
Break-glass detectors comprise a microphone and an amplifier that are tuned to the frequency generated by breaking glass. 

• 
Inertia sensors detect vibrations associated with forced entry into premises. 

• 
Personal attack buttons are connected to an alarm system and always active. In the event of an emergency, they can be operated to cause a full alarm condition. 




. Figure 12.42 PIR movement detector 
Audible warning device 
Audible warning devices emit sound when the alarm is activated, alerting people within earshot to the presence of an intruder. Typical sounds include bells, sirens and voice warnings. The audible alarm may also be accompanied by flashing lights. 





Surveillance systems 
CCTV is a powerful deterrent to crime, working with other security systems to protect people and property. It operates on mains-derived 230 V AC electricity, with accessories using 12 V. 
A typical CCTV surveillance system comprises: 
• 
site cameras, which can be internal, external, static and/or fully functional (pan–tilt–zoom, PTZ) 

• 
illumination, provided as either standard white or infrared (IR) light 

• 
detectors in the form of beams or PIR sensors 

• 
a public address (PA) system, which can be used for audio challenge 

• 
a system controller (either digital video recorder, DVR, or network video recorder, NVR) 

• 
a CCTV transmitter unit. 


The system is connected using PVC-insulated and PVC-sheathed multi-core cable and coaxial cable, with communications connected using Cat 5/6 data cable.

Fire alarm systems 
Fire alarm systems provide early detection and warning of a fire. They usually consist of a control panel linked to fire detectors and manual call points (often referred to as detection zones) and alarm circuits. The systems operate on mains-derived 230 V AC electricity and also contain a backup battery. Detectors use 24 V DC. 
Prior to a fire alarm system being designed and installed, a risk assessment should be undertaken to define its main objectives. 

334 

Fire alarm systems must be fit for purpose. BS 5839 defines different categories: 
• 
Category M systems rely on manual operation by the people using the building. The usual method of raising the alarm is to break the glass on a manual call point. 

• 
Category L systems provide automatic fire detection (AFD) and are designed primarily to protect life. This category is subdivided, according to the areas of the building that require the installation of AFD. 

• 
Category P systems provide AFD and are designed primarily to protect property. This category is subdivided, with P1 requiring AFD in all areas of the building and P2 requiring AFD only in specific parts of the building.

. Figure 12.45 Fire alarm systems 
The fire alarm control panel (FACP) contains the: 
• 
electronics that supervise and monitor the integrity of the wiring and components of the fire alarm system 

• 
switches to allow the sounders to be activated or silenced and the detectors to be reset following an alarm. 


There are usually several fire-detection zones, comprising a mixture of automatic fire detectors and manual call points. The size of a zone is limited to 2000 m2 and should not cover more than one storey. 
Fire detectors can be smoke or heat activated and are what is known as initiating devices, sending a signal to the fire alarm control panel to activate the alarm circuit. 
A manual call point consists of a simple switch with a resistor in series with it. When the call point is activated, the resistor is switched across the line and a current of 50–80 mA is drawn, sending a signal to the fire alarm control panel to activate the alarm circuit. 

. Figure 12.46 Manual call point 
The system is connected using fire-performance (FP) cables, with communications connected using fire­resistant UTP Cat 5/6 data cable. 

Access control systems 
Access control systems ensure that only authorised persons are able to enter a location, whether that is an individual room or a whole site. They can be used anywhere within a building and its grounds, for example: 
• 
external gates and barriers 

• 
main entrances 

• 
doors, turnstiles and lifts inside the building. 



The primary purpose of these systems is to protect a building’s occupants and/or contents from threats arising from unauthorised access. As such, they ensure that a building owner is able to meet their statutory duty of care. 
A successful system will be able to maintain the security of the building while managing the access requirements of different users. It may also be possible to record the movements of those users. 
Access control systems operate on mains-derived 230 V AC electricity, with accessories using 12 V. They are connected using PVC-insulated and PVC-sheathed multi-core cable, with communications connected using Cat 5/6 data cable. 
Types of access control system include: 
• 
stand alone, with a single entry point converted to an access control solution from a mechanical one 

• online, where the decision to grant access is made by an electronic access control (EAC) system 

• 
fully integrated/wireless, through incorporation into a building’s existing security system. 


Typical access control installations on a single door require a reader or keypad, door monitor, lock manager and press-to-exit switch.

. Figure 12.47 Access control system 
Access control systems rely on a person being recognised and validated using a credential, such as: 
• 
something the person has, for example a key card, tag, token or smartphone app 

• 
something the person knows, for example a password or PIN 

• 
a person’s biometric data, for example their fingerprint. 




1.7Refrigeration systems 
Refrigeration systems reduce the temperature of a space or substance by removing unwanted heat. They are used as part of: 
• 
HVAC systems, to ensure the comfort of building users 

• 
cooling systems for industrial processes 

• 
cooling systems for keeping products fresh in the food and drink manufacturing sector (for example in cold rooms). 


They comprise a combination of components and equipment connected in sequential order to produce the refrigeration effect. 
1.8Ventilation systems 
Ventilation systems are used to change the air within an enclosed space in order to: 
• 
provide fresh air 

• 
manage the oxygen content in the air 

• 
control levels of carbon dioxide 

• 
prevent damp and control moisture 

• 
remove excess heat 

• 
remove airborne contaminants. 

Ventilation can be achieved by either natural or mechanical means. The requirements for air change rates in a building are covered in the Building Regulations and vary depending on the: 

• 
type of building 

• 
building’s occupancy levels 

• 
activity the building has been designed for. 


Natural (non-mechanical) ventilation systems 
Natural ventilation provides air changes within a building using components such as air bricks, louvres, trickle vents or openable windows. It relies on wind effects and pressure and the principles of convection. 



. Figure 12.49 Stack effect 
Passive stack ventilation is an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method of ventilation with zero running costs. The system consists of vertical ducts sized at 100 to 150 mm in diameter, with grilles installed at ceiling level which are connected to terminals above the ridge height of the roof. Air movement within the building is achieved by a mixture of the warm air and air flowing over the roof. Fresh air is drawn into the building through the trickle vents in the windows and doors. 

Mechanical ventilation systems 
There are three categories of mechanical ventilation system: 
• 
natural inlet and mechanical extract 

• 
mechanical inlet and natural extract 

• 
mechanical inlet and mechanical extract. 


Mechanical extract ventilation (MEV) 
Mechanical-extract ventilation (MEV) systems are suitable for both domestic and commercial properties where passive stack ventilation is considered inadequate. While comprising a similar arrangement of vertical ducts and ceiling-level grilles connected to roof terminals, they also have a low-powered fan located in the roof structure that runs continuously. These systems can incorporate humidity sensors to automatically increase air flow and may be boosted by manual control when necessary. 


. Figure 12.51 Mechanical-extract ventilation (MEV) system 
Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) systems 
Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) systems share the same working principles as MEV systems, with the addition of a fresh air supply fan and a heat exchanger. They extract warm, stale air from inside a building and pass it through a heat exchanger, where the heat is transferred to incoming fresh air supplied by the fan. The warmed fresh air passes into the building while the cooled stale air is extracted into the atmosphere. By recovering the heat in the exhaust air, these systems improve a building’s energy efficiency. 
Contaminated air Fresh air drawn

2.1 Effects on the environment 
In order to minimise negative effects on the environment, it is important to: 
• 
specify and install energy-efficient products and systems 

• 
measure accurately to avoid waste 

• 
use materials correctly 

• 
follow environmental policies. 

A range of published documents support compliance, including: 

• 
the Domestic Building Services Compliance Guide 

• 
Approved Document L: Conservation of fuel and power. 


BSE systems must be commissioned according to the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure they work efficiently. This includes setting up system controls for optimum performance and instructing building users on how the system is operated. 
It is particularly important to consider the environment when decommissioning systems, whether temporarily or permanently. This includes ensuring the: 
• 
correct recycling of materials and waste 

• 
correct disposal of system fluids 



2.2 Effects on trades 
Other trades may be affected by the activities involved in work on BSE systems. For example, the isolation of a cold-water system during installation work could affect other BSE trades who require a connection to the water supply and onsite construction operatives such as bricklayers and plasterers who require water for mixing their materials. 

2.3 Loss of service 
While undertaking work on BSE systems and components, a loss of service may occur: 
• 
Isolating the water supply in a domestic property will result in no drinking-water outlets and a loss of sanitary conveniences. 

• 
Isolating the electrical supply in a commercial building can result in the loss of a range of BSE systems, such as electrical outlets, heating and ventilation systems and protection systems where battery backup is not installed. 


Where possible, alternative supplies should be provided to minimise disruption to end users. End users should be informed about which part of the system will be out of service, how long for and the location of/arrangements for alternative supplies. 


3.1Fans 
Fans are used in a range of BSE systems and components, for example: 
• 
in gas central-heating boilers to discharge products of combustion to the outside while at the same time drawing in fresh air 

• 
in ducted ventilation systems either to draw air into the system or to discharge stale air. 


The function of the fan will depend on its position. 
The two types of fan commonly used in BSE systems are referred to as centrifugal and axial. They are defined by the direction of air flow through them. These two types can then be split into subtypes relating to flow volume/ pressure characteristics, size, noise and vibration. 
Centrifugal fans 
In centrifugal fans, the air enters the impeller along its axis and is then discharged radially from the impeller by the centrifugal motion. 
There are several different shapes of blade that can make up the impeller, including: 
• 
backward curved 

• 
forward curved 

• 
radial. 





Axial fans 
In axial fans, air passes through the fan in line with the axis of rotation. Types include: 
• 
tube axial, consisting of a propeller or disk-type wheel within a cylinder 

• 
vane axial, consisting of a disk-type wheel within a cylinder, with a set of air-guide vanes located either before or after the wheel 

• 
mixed-flow inline fan, a development of the axial fan that combines the characteristics of both axial and centrifugal fans. 


Heat rejection to outdoor air 





Pumps 
Pumps are used in BSE systems to circulate fluids: 
• 
Hot-water circulating pumps are installed on the hot-water return (pumping into the cylinder) and aid efficient circulation to and from the cylinder. They are controlled by a simple clock and manufactured from bronze to ensure they do not corrode. If a pump fails, hot water will not be pumped around the system, which will reduce efficiency and increase hot-water draw-off times. 

• 
Shower pumps increase shower flow rate: 

• 
A single-impeller pump is designed to boost the mixed supply from a shower mixer valve to the shower outlet. 

• 
A twin-impeller pump is designed to boost the hot­


and cold-water supplies to a shower mixer valve. Failure of a shower pump will result in insufficient flow at the shower valve/outlet. 
• 
Central-heating circulators (or pumps) are simple electric motors with a fluted waterwheel-like impeller that circulates water around the system by centrifugal force. The circulator must be positioned with care to avoid faults that could lead to problems with corrosion by aeration. 

• 
Cold-water booster pumps are used to pump (boost) cold-water supplies and draw-off water to upper floors of a building. Failure of this component will result in no water on the upper floors. 



Boilers 
Boilers generate the heat required to warm the systems they are connected to. They are generally heated by one of the following: 
• 
solid fuel 

• 
gas • oil 

• 
electricity. 


Connection methods vary, depending on the type of system they serve. In addition to the heat source, there is usually a series of time and temperature controls.

Chillers 
Chillers generate cold liquid by removing heat via a compression or an absorption refrigeration cycle. This liquid can then be distributed through a heat exchanger to chill equipment or through other HVAC processes. 

.
 Vapour-compression chillers are the most common type. They use a mechanical compressor to force refrigerant around the cooling system. 

. 
Screw chillers use a rotary-screw compressor. 

.
 Vapour-absorption chillers use a heat source to move refrigerant around the cooling system. 

. 
Ammonia chillers use water as an absorbent and ammonia as a refrigerant. 

. 
Air-cooled chillers remove heat with fans that force air across exposed condenser tubes. 

. 
Water-cooled chillers remove heat with pumps that send water through a sealed condenser and disperse it through a cooling tower.

Thermoelectric refrigeration is the process of pumping heat energy out of an insulated chamber in order to reduce the temperature of the chamber to below that of the surrounding air. It uses a principle called the Peltier effect to pump heat electronically. 


Heat pumps 
A heat pump warms or cools a building by moving heat from a low-temperature reservoir to another reservoir at a higher temperature. Its working principles are the same as for a refrigerator, which creates heat while making the refrigerator cold. 
The process is known as the vapour-compression refrigeration cycle and involves compressing a gas (called the refrigerant) with a compressor until it becomes a liquid. This generates useful heat that can be used to warm a building. When the pressure is released through an expansion valve, very cold temperatures are generated, which can be used for cooling a building. This process is reversible. 
Heating system 


Outside air 

. Figure 12.57 Components of a heat pump 
There are several different types of heat pump: 
• 
Air-to-air heat pumps are used mostly in commercial buildings as reverse-cycle heat pumps that can provide both heating and cooling. 

• 
Air-to-water heat pumps are used to heat swimming pools and to provide hot water and space heating for dwellings. 

• 
Water-to-air heat pumps can use wells or boreholes but can also be installed with many units connected together on a common closed water loop to transfer energy from hot to cold points of a building. 

• 
Ground-to-air heat pumps use constant ground temperatures to provide the heat source, with warm air delivered to the building. 


• Ground-to-water heat pumps are the same as ground-to-air heat pumps but used with underfloor heating systems, radiators or wall heaters. 
Failure of a heat pump within a system will result in no heating or cooling within a property. 


A wiring system comprises a cable or collection of cables used to deliver power or services. The cables may be supported by cable trays, baskets, clips or cleats (sometimes referred to as a support system). A cable management/containment system further supports, protects and separates cables, usually by enclosing them in conduit, ducting or trunking. There are many different types of wiring system. 
4.1 Cable types 
Cables have three main parts: 
• 
The conductor carries the electrical current and is commonly made from copper, either in a single piece or multiple strands. It may also be made from other materials, such as aluminium. 

• 
The insulation is a layer of non-conductive material that covers the conductor. It provides basic protection against electric shock, as well as being a means to identify the use of the conductor. 

• 
The sheath is a secondary layer of non-conductive material surrounding the insulation. It holds the 


insulated conductors together in one cable and also provides minor mechanical protection to the inner conductor. 


. Figure 12.58 Cables 
Thermoplastic cables are commonly referred to as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) cables and come in various shapes, sizes and forms, including: 
• 
single-core 

• 
twin-core and CPC (circuit protective conductor) flat profile 

• 
three-core and CPC flat profile 

• 
multi-core flexible. 

The type of cable used will depend on its application: 

• 
non-fixed appliances are connected using flexible cable 

• 
twin-core and CPC flat-profile cable are used for lighting and socket circuits. 

In domestic installations, the most common cables are: 

• 
twin-core and CPC flat profile 

• 
three-core and CPC flat profile. 


Mineral-insulated copper-clad cable (MICC) is manufactured using copper and magnesium oxide as the insulation with an outer polymer sheath. It is used in high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions, resists oxidation and has low flammability. 

Steel-wire-armoured (SWA) cable is hard-wearing and made up of black PVC sheath, cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation, copper conductors and steel-wire armouring. It is used for underground systems, cable networks and power networks, as well as indoor and outdoor applications such as power to sheds and garages. It is available in a wide range of core options. 

. Figure 12.60 Steel-wire-armoured cable 
Data cables are used in data networking and telecommunications networks to transmit electronic information from a source to a destination. Cable types include Cat 5 and Cat 6, which are twisted-pair cables used for ethernet and network applications (Cat 6 is an evolution of Cat 5 that supports higher bandwidths). 


fibres are typically glass or plastic pipes contained in a protective tube. 


. Figure 12.63 Fire-resistant cable 
4.2 Electrical accessories 
There is a wide range of accessories that may be required when installing electrical systems. These can be split into two categories: 
• 
first-fix accessories, such as electrical back boxes and jointing boxes 

• 
second-fix accessories, such as sockets, switches and pull cords. 


.

Switched socket (double gang)  Socket circuits with up to 13 A plugs  



4.3Containment 
Conduit 
Where an installation is likely to be subjected to external influences which may damage the wiring, a common method of protection is conduit. Conduit is available in both steel and PVC and comes in many different forms, including: 
• 
solid-steel extruded 

• 
solid-steel rolled 

• 
flexible steel 

• 
rigid PVC 

• 
flexible PVC. 




Typical conduit external diameters are 16, 20, 25 and 32 mm, and it is supplied in 3 m and 3.75 m lengths. 

. Table 12.13 Advantages and disadvantages of using conduit 
Advantages  Disadvantages  
• There is increased mechanical protection of the wiring. • Rewiring can be carried out relatively easily, providing all cables are replaced at the same time. • Using steel conduit can minimise the risk of fire spreading. • Conduit can be used as the circuit protective conductor (CPC).  • Installation costs are high, due to the time and materials required. • PVC conduit is directly affected by UV and can become discoloured and brittle in direct sunlight. • Both PVC and steel conduit can be affected by acids, alkalis and corrosive fumes, with steel conduit being susceptible to rust which can form on the inside.  

Steel and PVC conduits use some common accessories in their installation, but they also have their own specific accessories. 
Accessory  Description  
Junction box  Used at the end of a conduit run  
Accessory  Description  
Through box  Used as a through link  
Angle box  Used for going round corners or changing direction  
Four-way box  Sometimes called a cross box; has four spouts at 90° to one another  
H-box  Has four spouts forming a letter H, with two on each side  
Strap saddle  Used when the conduit is to be secured in place directly on the surface, with no gap at the back; also referred to as a stamp saddle  

Trunking 
Trunking is an enclosure for a wiring system with one removeable or hinged side. It enables cables to be installed easily and provides them with a level of mechanical protection. 
Trunking comes in two forms: 
• 
PVC 

• 
steel. 



. Figure 12.65 Trunking 
Segregated trunking 
Irrespective of whether trunking is PVC or steel, it can be split into different sections or compartments. This can assist with segregation of specific circuits, for example keeping data cables separate from low­voltage power circuits, and keeping band-1 and band-2 circuits apart. This will reduce any interference between systems and ensure each system can be easily identified. 
Cable tray 
Sometimes the size or type of cable and the route or required bend radius mean it is not practical to use trunking or conduit. Instead, armoured cables are used in conjunction with cable tray. 
Cable tray comes in several forms, including: 
• 
heavy-gauge perforated 

• 
light-gauge perforated 

• 
heavy-gauge solid 

• 
light-gauge solid. 


The choice of cable tray depends on the application, but heavy gauge is used for larger cables or where there is a greater mass of smaller cables to be supported. Heavy­gauge cable tray tends to have walls with bent-over edges, whereas the walls on light-gauge cable tray are straight with no returned edge. 

352 
As with all other forms of support system, standard accessories are available, including: 
• 
couplers • nut bolts 

• 
tees • washers 

• 
crosses • full-threaded rods 

• 
brackets • anchor fasteners/bullet 

• 
coupler plates fasteners. 


Cable basket 
Also referred to as basket tray, cable basket is commonly used for the structured cabling of information technology systems. The main purpose is to provide support rather than protection, as the cables are just laid in the basket. However, this means that wiring can be installed easily. 



Several different electricity supply systems may be used in premises, catering for specific requirements. These may be direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) operating at different voltages, and in the case of AC the supply may be single- or three­phase. For more on the use of DC and AC and different voltages, see Chapter 2. 
DC is not used for public electricity supplies (with the exception of the links between England, the Netherlands, Ireland and France) but has some work applications, such as battery-operated works plant (for example forklift trucks). Certain parts of the UK railway system, in particular the London Underground and services in southern England, also use DC for traction supplies. 
AC is the distribution system of choice for electricity suppliers all over the world, mostly due to its versatility. An AC supply is compatible with a wider range of circuit arrangements and supply voltages, and transformers enable the supply voltage to be changed up or down. 

5.1Single-phase supply systems 
The simplest AC supply arrangement is a two-wire system, known as single phase. It is used in both domestic and work premises for applications such as lighting and socket outlets. 
The two conductors are referred to as the line conductor 
(L) and the neutral conductor (N). The N conductor is connected to earth at every distribution substation on the public supply system and therefore its voltage, with reference to earth, should be no more than a few volts at any point. The voltage between the L and N conductors corresponds to the nominal supply voltage (230 V). 

5.2 Three-phase and neutral supply systems 
While single-phase AC supplies are adequate for domestic premises, the much higher loads typical of industrial and commercial premises need to use very large conductors to carry the high currents involved. The high currents also give rise to a large voltage drop. However, it is possible to use a multi-phase arrangement, which effectively combines several single-phase supplies. If three coils spaced 120° apart are rotated in a uniform magnetic field, this creates an elementary system which will provide a symmetrical three-phase supply. 
The usual arrangement is a three-phase system employing four conductors – three separate L conductors and a common N conductor. Most substation transformers in the distribution system that delivers power to houses are wound in a delta-to-star configuration. A neutral point is created on the star side of the transformer. 
The three L conductors (L1, L2 and L3) were previously distinguished by standard colour markings: red, yellow and blue. However, European harmonisation resulted in these conductor colours being changed to brown, black and grey. 




Balanced three-phase supply system 
In the UK, electricity is provided from a delta-star transformer, with an earthed star point on the secondary side of the transformer. This is normally distributed as a three-phase four-wire system. 
Balanced three-phase systems, as described above, will balance out, therefore giving no neutral current. Single-phase loads require a neutral connection, which will carry any out-of-balance current. This should be kept to a minimum, to reduce cable and switchgear sizes and ensure maximum transformer use. Any difference in load will be ‘mopped up’ by current flowing in the neutral conductor. 
It must be mentioned at this point that the effects of neutral current become much more complex with different loads. Values of neutral current can be determined simply by using a scale drawing based on an equilateral triangle. If all phases are balanced, therefore equal, all three sides of the triangle will meet. If they are not balanced, there will be a gap, which represents the neutral current. 
For more on supply systems, see Chapter 2. 


6.1Earthing 
To reduce the risk of electric shock, circuits are protected using a system called automatic disconnection of supply (ADS). 
The green and yellow earth cables in an electrical circuit are called circuit protective conductors (CPCs). Every exposed metallic part in an electrical circuit must be joined to a CPC to ensure it is connected to the earth path should a fault occur. This will ensure the low-resistance earth path creates a high fault current, causing quick disconnection. 

Earth cables play a major part in achieving ADS in the event of a fault to earth. If a fault exists between line and earth, there is a major risk of electric shock, as someone may come into contact with metallic parts. 

6.2 TN-C-S (PME) systems 
The TN-C-S system is now common throughout the UK, as it allows the district network operator (DNO) to provide a low-voltage supply with a reliable earthing arrangement to many installations across the country. It is also known as protective multiple earthing (PME). It relies on the neutral being earthed close to the source of supply and at points throughout the distribution system. There is also a neutral-to-earth connection at the intake of the installation. 
As the DNO uses the combined neutral and earth return path (known as a protective earthed neutral or PEN), the maximum external earth fault loop impedance declared by the DNO is 0.35 .. There may be a number of consumers using the supply cable. A rise in current flow will create a voltage rise in the PEN, which needs multiple connections to the general mass of earth along the supply route.

There are risks. If the PEN conductor becomes an open circuit in the supply, current flowing through the installation will not have a path back to the substation through the supplier’s cable. Instead, current could try to follow an alternative path through the earthing system of the installation, which may include service pipework or the general mass of earth. Unfortunately, it could be people who make that link between the earthed metallic equipment and the earth. As a result, certain installations such as petrol filling stations and some construction sites and caravan parks, cannot be

supplied by TN-C-S arrangements. Even in domestic or commercial installations some restrictions may apply, such as certain outbuilding supplies including garages, sheds and workshops. In these cases, TT systems are preferred (see below).

6.3 TN-S systems 
A TN-S earthing configuration has only one neutral-to­earth connection, which is as near as practicable to the source (supply transformer). In low-voltage supplies, the consumer’s earth conductor is connected to the metallic sheath of the DNO’s supply cable. This sheath provides a separate route back to the substation transformer. Because the return path is usually a material such as steel, the DNO will normally declare a maximum external earth fault loop impedance (Ze) of 0.8 O. 
6.4TT systems 
This type of system is configured in much the same way as a TN-S system in terms of the earthing of the supply source. However, a TT system does not provide the consumer with an earth connection. Instead, the earth for the consumer’s installation has to be supplied by the consumer, usually by driving earth rods into the ground or burying metallic plates or strips to provide a path of low-enough impedance through the ground to give protection. 

356 
TT systems are usually installed either where a TN-C-S arrangement is not permitted (for example in a petrol filling station or in rural installations where the supply is provided via overhead poles) or where there is no opportunity to provide other types of system. As the earth return path uses the general mass of earth, external earth fault loop impedance values (Ze) may be very high where different soil types exist, meaning further shock-protection measures such as residual current devices (RCDs) may be required to provide ADS.

7.1 Cables, accessories and equipment 
Lead-sheathed cable 
In some of the earliest electrical installations in around 1880, multi-core cables were available with wax-impregnated cotton and silk insulation and lead sheaths. As this type of cable is over a hundred years old and the insulation around the inner cores will have deteriorated, any installation still using it should be considered unsafe and isolated immediately. A failure of the inner insulation could cause the outer lead coating to become live. 


Vulcanised India rubber (VIR) insulated cable 
Before PVC cables and up until the 1960s, electrical cables used vulcanised India rubber (VIR) for insulation and protection. Rubber is perishable so, over time, the sheathing on the cable becomes brittle and starts to crack and break away, exposing the copper in the cable. This can create the risk of electric shock, fire or immediate loss of power due to a short circuit rupturing the protective fuses. 

Cable colours Another major problem is unreliability, due to: 
• using the wrong gauge of wire when changing the UK cable colours were harmonised with countries in fuse mainland Europe in 2006, as shown in Table 12.15. 
• the wire being labelled with an incorrect current rating 
. Table 12.15 Types, colours and functions of cables 

• the number of times and length of time that a fuse wire has been subjected to overload. 
Type  Colour of cable  Function  
Live  Brown  Carries electricity to the appliance  
Neutral  Blue  Transfers electricity away from the appliance  
Earth  Green and yellow  Connects the electrical appliance or installation with the ground (vital for safety)  

During a new installation, electricians should attach the correct-coloured insulation, sheathes, or sleeving to the wires, to enable easy identification. Where there is any mixing of old and new colours, cables should be clearly marked with the relevant colour codes. 

Table 12.16 shows typical cable sizes available, with corresponding current and maximum power ratings. 
. Table 12.16 Cable sizes 
Cable size  Current (A)  Maximum power (W)  
1.0 mm2  10  2400  
1.25 mm2  13  3120  
1.5 mm2  15  3600  
2.5 mm2  20  4800  
4.0 mm2  25  6000  

BS 3036: rewireable fuses 
A fuse is a basic protection device that is destroyed and breaks the circuit should the current exceed the fuse rating. In older equipment, it may be just a length of fuse wire fixed between two terminals. These are now becoming uncommon, as electrical installations are rewired or updated. 
One of the main problems associated with rewireable fuses is the overall lack of protection, including insufficient breaking-capacity ratings caused by overcurrent or a fault in the installation.

Non-fire-rated consumer units/distribution boards 
Consumer units are a type of distribution board typically installed in domestic premises to provide control, distribution and protection for the various circuits within the electrical power system. They can include: 
• 
circuit breakers (CB) 

• 
residual current breakers with overload (RCBO) 

• 
fuses. 


They also have a main switch to isolate the entire installation. 
In early installations, it was acceptable to install a consumer unit with a wooden back box, and many are still in existence. However, the IET Wiring Regulations require that consumer units in domestic premises are now manufactured from non­combustible material to contain any fire within the enclosure and to minimise the spread of fire. Non­fire-rated consumer units and distribution boards add an additional source of fuel for a fire.

13 Maintenance principles 


There are two types of maintenance: 
• 
planned preventative maintenance (PPM) 

• 
reactive maintenance. 

The systems and facilities found in large buildings require different maintenance schedules, for example: 

• 
plumbing and heating systems 

• 
fire detection and alarm systems 

• 
wiring and lighting systems 

• 
ventilation and air-conditioning systems 

• 
drainage systems 

• 
communication and data systems. 


1.1Planned preventative maintenance 
Planned preventative maintenance (PPM) refers to maintenance activity that is planned, documented and scheduled. It aims to reduce downtime by having all necessary resources on hand, such as labour and parts, and a strategy to use those resources. 
PPM is usually performed on larger systems and commercial/industrial installations. Certain items are serviced or replaced according to a predetermined schedule, regardless of condition, so that faults can be identified and prevented before they become a problem. This could involve out-of-hours or weekend work, depending on the installation. 
When planning preventative maintenance, the following factors need to be taken into consideration: 
• 
business type 

• 
cost 


• other business commitments and operational needs, for example downtime of a production line. 
Larger organisations may choose to schedule PPM to avoid the risk of downtime with its associated costs. For example, a large warehouse storing frozen food would implement PPM for its refrigeration units, to ensure stock is constantly kept at the correct temperature and avoid loss of stock through system breakdown. 
In contrast, a small wholesaler is more likely to adopt a reactive maintenance programme due to the costs associated with PPM, including the replacement of parts that are still functioning efficiently.

. Table 13.1 Examples and benefits of PPM for different BSE systems 
Type of system  Examples of PPM  Benefits of PPM  
Plumbing  Re-washering taps/valves Replacing FOVs  Saves water  
Fire detection  Replacing smoke/heat detectors  Ensures compliance with standards and regulations (BS 5839)  
Air conditioning  Recharging system  Allows the system to run efficiently, ensuring optimal conditions for end users  
Heating  Servicing and replacing thermostatic radiator valves and lockshield valves  Reduces energy costs  
Drainage  Checking and replacing all traps  Eliminates smells and odours from main sewers  
Ventilation  Checking and replacing filters on air-handling units (AHUs)  Ensures Legionella-free systems  
Wiring and electrical installation  Servicing and replacing miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) and fuses  Ensures the system is operating optimally, keeping users safe  


1.2Reactive maintenance 
Reactive maintenance is also known as unplanned or emergency maintenance. Unlike PPM, reactive maintenance is carried out when a system (or part of a system) fails. Examples might include: 
• 
a WC system overflowing with water because a FOV has failed 

• 
an intruder alarm constantly activating because of a 


defective sensor. A building services engineer might receive a phone call out of hours to manage reactive maintenance jobs – this is referred to as a call-out. It is important to understand which types of problem need to be prioritised and to take action accordingly. 
Unlike PPM, reactive maintenance may require additional problem-solving skills in order to maintain systems in the short term, for example due to a lack of part availability. 




A maintenance plan includes information on: 
• 
specific maintenance tasks that need to be carried out 

• 
the correct way to carry out those tasks 

• 
the premises where the tasks will be carried out 

• 
priority levels for the tasks 

• 
deadlines, scheduled dates or frequency for the tasks 

• 
equipment or parts required to complete the tasks 

• 
manufacturer manuals or instructions. 


An effective plan covers every aspect of an organisation’s assets and systems, to ensure the building functions efficiently. It may also prioritise systems or areas and provide an order (or sequence) in which maintenance tasks should be carried out. 
Risk management might also be applied when producing a maintenance plan for certain types of system, for example fire detection and alarm systems, data systems and electrical systems. 

Maintenance tasks will vary depending on the type of system. Some systems may require a visual inspection to check for any visible faults, while others may require components to be tested physically. 
A building services engineer may be responsible for maintaining various systems across multiple sites and locations. This may involve travelling both locally and nationally, sometimes at short notice for reactive maintenance, and this should be factored into a maintenance plan. 
Most maintenance plans have deadlines for when vital system components require maintenance. These should be scheduled to allow for ordering of parts or changing of components if required. They are often planned ahead of the manufacturer’s requirements, to allow for other unplanned maintenance taking priority. 
Prioritising tasks on a maintenance plan is important, as some components/systems require a higher level of maintenance than others. This may be in response to a health and safety/regulatory requirement or simply to maintain business efficiency. 

The frequency of maintenance depends on the system and its components, for example some maintenance plans might be annual while others are monthly. 
When maintenance plans are devised, it is important to factor in what equipment or parts may be required and allow plenty of time for them to be ordered if necessary. For example, a plumbing and heating engineer may carry FOVs or isolation valves in stock so that they are readily available. However, a refrigeration and air-conditioning engineer may not carry a specific condenser for an air­conditioning unit in their van and so will need to ensure the correct part is ordered in a timely manner. 
In order to meet the manufacturer’s standards, it is important for an engineer to refer to installation and servicing manuals when carrying out maintenance work. Failure to do so may affect the warranty and ultimately the efficiency of the system.

. Figure 13.5 Thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) 






The frequency of maintenance tasks will vary according to the system. Some systems require priority maintenance to meet regulatory requirements. 
For example, the boiler in a rented property requires regular servicing to meet Benchmark and warranty requirements, and an annual service to meet the requirements of the Landlord Gas Safety Certificate. This must be carried out by a Gas Safe engineer. Electrical systems in a rented property require an annual electrical inspection by a qualified and competent electrician. 


When carrying out PPM and reactive maintenance, BSE engineers use a variety of documentation both to perform the tasks and to record the work completed. 
Paper-based documentation, such as manuals and logbooks, should remain on site and be easily accessible. Electronic documentation, on tablets and mobile devices, can be uploaded and stored centrally for later retrieval. 
Types of documentation required for maintenance and verification of maintenance activities include: 
• 
manufacturer’s instructions 

• 
maintenance checklists 

• 
servicing logbooks 

• 
maintenance schedules 

• 
job sheets 

• 
condition reports. 


4.1 Manufacturer’s instructions 
Manufacturer’s instructions come in three formats: 
• 
Manufacturer’s literature acts like a catalogue for a manufacturer’s components or systems. It provides details such as specifications, performance data, running costs and dimensions. 

• 
Installation instructions describe the installation process for an appliance or system and give specific details of site and input service requirements (for plumbing this might be flow rates or pressure required; for electrical systems it might be the amps and voltage required). They also detail commissioning procedures. 

• 
Servicing/maintenance instructions detail the procedures and tasks involved in performance testing and replacing of components (for example changing air filters during maintenance of an air-conditioning system). They also specify correct performance data, which will indicate to the building services engineer whether components or systems are working to the correct standards. This document is important as part of both PPM and reactive maintenance. 


4.2Maintenance checklists 
A maintenance checklist identifies tasks to be carried out on specific components of an appliance or an entire system. It might form part of the manufacturer’s servicing/maintenance instructions. 
Maintenance checklists can be sub-divided to cover individual sections of larger systems, for example: 
• 
a checklist for a fire detection system might cover sprinklers, fire extinguishers, fire blankets, hose reels, heat/smoke detectors and alarms/buzzers 

• 
a checklist for a heating system might cover pipework, radiators, TRVs, lockshield valves, DOVs, the expansion vessel, pressure gauge and filling loop. 


4.3Servicing logbooks 
Servicing logbooks record the maintenance, servicing or commissioning of a component, appliance or system. They inform a servicing engineer about which prior tasks, repairs or replacements have been carried out. 
A gas boiler service would be documented in the Benchmark Scheme logbook, to ensure the manufacturer’s warranty remains intact. This contains details such as model number, serial number, installation date, service dates and performance data such as rating, gas pressure and flue temperatures. 


. Figure 13.8 Benchmark Scheme logbook 
4.4Maintenance schedules 
There are two types of maintenance schedule: 
• 
manufacturers’ maintenance schedules, for example a drainage system might need a schedule for annual inspection and maintenance 

• 
individualised maintenance schedules which are bespoke to a specific system and risk-rated depending on the type of system, for example a hot-water system in a gym might require monthly maintenance to check for Legionella and ensure temperatures are correct at the point of use. 


4.5 Job sheets 
A building services engineer uses a job sheet to inform them of the client’s name, site location, date and time, priority of the task and work to be carried out. 
A job sheet could require a: 
• 
visual inspection to check for wear and tear or external damage 

• 
more detailed check of components not functioning efficiently 

• 
full-system check of individual components, comparing performance data in the service instructions against how the system is working. 


371 

4.6Condition reports 
A condition report could form part of the job sheet and highlights any defects with a component, appliance or system. This information could come from visual inspections or performance tests. 
A condition report also covers maintenance carried out previously and what parts or components have been changed. 
The information on a condition report feeds into a maintenance plan or schedule and, if used as part of PPM, parts can be changed before they fail. 


On occasion, a building services engineer may not be able to rectify, replace or recommission a component, appliance or system due to a range of factors, for example: 
• 
The spare part is not carried in the van. 

• 
The spare part is special order only. 

• 
There is a lack of knowledge of the system due to it being outdated or new technology. 

• 
Incorrect information has been provided by the customer/client. 

• 
There is a lack of time due to a higher priority breakdown. 


When parts are not readily available, an engineer will need to place an order with a merchant or specialist supplier. If the part is in stock, it may be available immediately. However, if it is not in stock, it might be a special order or back order item, and the engineer has no control over how long this might take to deliver. 



When an engineer cannot rectify a fault immediately, this can have negative implications for the customer, client or business, for example: 
• 
time 

• 
costs 

• 
downtime of systems 

• 
loss of income 

• 
increased hazards 

• 
loss of services. 

The costs of PPM are usually known in advance, because the maintenance is scheduled and expected. However, the costs for reactive maintenance can vary greatly depending on the: 

• 
time of day (out-of-hours call-outs are more expensive) 

• 
time of year (call-outs on bank holidays are more expensive) 

• 
type of system that requires maintenance (some require specialist engineers). 


It is difficult to put a price on reactive maintenance, as the engineer might not be able to diagnose the reason for failure or determine the parts required until they are on site. 
Some breakdowns have an impact on the downtime of systems: 
• 
A leaking flow pipe on a central-heating system will require a drain down of the whole system in order to carry out a repair. While the drain down is taking place, the heating system will be out of action. 

• 
An electrical system needs to be isolated while an electrician changes components in a consumer unit. This will have an impact on electrical items being used within the building. 


Downtime of certain systems can have a costly impact. For example, downtime of an electrical supply in a food manufacturing plant will stop production. This could have a knock-on effect, making it difficult for the business to fulfil orders and meet deadlines. 
Downtime of systems should always be a last resort but might be unavoidable if there is a lack of spare parts or it is unsafe to run the system while faulty. 
Some businesses may have insurance to cover loss of income due to downtime, but this is an additional cost to the business. Having PPM for BSE systems can help with avoiding downtime, because the maintenance has been planned in advance. Some businesses have a higher risk and require increased PPM to ensure systems have minimal or no downtime. 

When certain systems break down, an engineer might need to make the system safe before carrying out any repairs. For example, if a gas appliance is leaking, a Gas Safe engineer might have to isolate the gas supply at the meter point to make the system safe, due to the increased risk of explosion. Similarly, an electrician would need to isolate the system at the consumer unit where there is a faulty RCD. 
Failure to identify hazards or risks when leaving a system operating under faulty conditions can have serious implications, including risk to life in some cases. 
If an engineer is forced to take a system out of action for long periods of time, it is good practice to have a back­up or secondary service available. This might include portable storage heaters to cover boiler failure, mobile air-conditioning units to cover a centralised RAC system, and portable generators to provide an electrical supply. 
An engineer could also use the following to help bring systems back into service as soon as practicable, thus helping to reduce inconvenience to a customer or business: 
• 
manufacturer’s technical support • online research 

• 
virtual assistants. 


Even an experienced building services engineer may require help or support in diagnosing a breakdown in a system. The first point of contact should always be the manufacturer’s technical support helpline. This allows the engineer to describe the fault and get expert advice from the manufacturer, who will know how to rectify problems that are not in the servicing manual. 

Some engineers use online search engines to research problems and find alternative solutions. These solutions might come from manufacturer or industry body forums, where similar problems are logged and resolutions suggested by other engineers. When researching online and visiting manufacturers’ websites, engineers may be able to access virtual assistants or live chat, where they are able to speak with experts online in real time. 
While carrying out maintenance and fixing breakdowns, particularly where work cannot be completed immediately, it is essential to keep the customer or business fully updated so they understand the costs and timeframes involved in bringing the system back into operation.

14 Tools, equipment and materials 


To ensure tools and equipment are fit for purpose, every operative using them must inspect them before use, clean them after use and follow appropriate maintenance routines. 
Materials must be selected in accordance with the work specification, inspected for good condition and used in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions and established best practice. 
It is important to be observant in order to identify potential problems with tools, equipment and materials. This will: 
• 
improve site safety 

• 
extend the life and usefulness of valuable resources 

• 
help ensure the completed project fully matches the design brief. 


1.1Tools and equipment 
In order to support reliability, productivity and safety on site, the operational efficiency of all tools and equipment must be maintained. The principles for ensuring items are fit for purpose apply equally to simple items such as screwdrivers and complex items such as self-levelling laser levels. 

. Figure 14.1 Regular safety inspections of equipment are essential 
Let us look at some examples of methods for ensuring items are fit for purpose. 
Portable appliance testing (PAT) 
Portable appliance testing (PAT) is an ongoing procedure that ensures electrical appliances are safe to use. Tools and equipment powered by electricity are inspected visually and tested electrically to identify possible faults. Typically, a checklist is followed to ensure all potential safety issues are addressed. 

Portable tools and items of equipment that are frequently moved from place to place are at greater risk of damage to exposed parts, such as attached power leads, projecting plug attachment points and surface switches. 
Even a new tool or piece of equipment should be visually checked before use, to ensure there is no damage that could make it unsafe. 


. Figure 14.2 A portable appliance test (PAT) instrument 
Calibration of instruments 
Tools and equipment used for measurement or testing can be relatively simple, such as a tape measure or thermometer. However, in construction engineering applications they are often sophisticated and complex in design. 
Where measurements must be accurately checked and maintained, the instrument of measurement must be calibrated periodically to maintain its reliability and effectiveness. In this context, calibration refers to the process of comparing, and if necessary adjusting, readings on an instrument to match an established and accepted external reference. 
Measuring and testing are an important part of the installation, commissioning and maintenance of many critical systems within the built environment. For example, a high-pressure gas-distribution system has pipework junctions, valves and other components that are typically connected using high-tensile steel bolts. These must be tightened to precise levels of torque. If the specified torque is not met and the bolts are tightened to a lower or higher torque value, there could be either leaks of gas or catastrophic failure of components, which in either case can be dangerous. 
The tool used to measure torque is known as a torque wrench, and the readings it displays must be calibrated to ensure its reliable and accurate function. 



Instrument  Application  
Laser distance meters  These are used for accurate measurement between stations. They easily provide straight-line distance measurements over undulating terrain.  
Coating thickness testers  These measure the thickness of protective paint coatings and membrane applications, to ensure consistency in coverage.  
Holiday detectors  These are used to detect flaws and porous areas in protective coatings applied to metal surfaces. The flaws may not be visible to the naked eye but must be addressed to avoid rust or corrosion.  
Electrical testers  A range of specific testers are used for electrical applications, such as PAT testers, socket testers, insulation testers and cable testers.  
Gas detectors  These are used to detect leaks in gas-delivery systems. Specific types can analyse flue gases to confirm burner efficiency in boilers for heating and hot-water systems.  




Instrument calibration is usually carried out by specialist companies or the instrument manufacturer. This ensures measurement standards are validated and documented as part of a system of quality verification. 
The calibration procedure will differ depending on the type of instrument, the environment in which it is used, and allowable tolerances in measuring and testing values. 

. Figure 14.4 Instruments used to test the hardness of concrete must be calibrated to maintain their accuracy 
Instruments are often identified by a unique serial number. This allows records to be generated, providing details about the most recent calibration date, the calibration interval, the next calibration date and any other relevant information specific to individual instruments and tools. 
Visual inspections 

Visually inspecting tools and equipment before use is an important habit to develop. A brief but careful examination of an item can quickly establish whether it needs repair or replacement. Not only will this prevent potential injuries, but it can also reduce the risk of failure or incorrect function of tools and equipment during a work task, which could lead to errors and production delays. 

For example, inspection of an optical or laser level could find signs of impact damage to the casing. The accuracy of this type of instrument could be affected by an impact, and if an operative carried on using the potentially defective item without further action, it could lead to incorrect levels and datum positions being established. This could have serious consequences. Constructing a building to incorrect reference levels may lead to costly alterations or even the need to completely rebuild the structure in order to fulfil the project specification. 


On a more basic level, simple hand tools should be inspected prior to use to confirm their suitability. For example, a screwdriver should not be used for piercing holes in materials. This could damage the tip or blade, causing it to slip when exerting pressure on a screw head. A brief visual inspection to confirm that the screwdriver is fit for purpose could reduce the risk of injury to the operative. 

. Figure 14.6 A brief visual inspection of this screwdriver shows it is not fit for purpose 
Before using hand tools, conduct a visual inspection to check for the following: 
• 
The surface of the tool is free from grease or oil. 

• 
Handles are not loose or cracked. 

• 
Blades or cutting parts are sharp and not cracked or chipped. 

• 
Chisels and punches do not have mushroomed heads. 

• 
The general condition is good. 



Before using portable power tools, conduct a visual inspection to check for the following: 
• 
The outside of the tool is free from oil, grease and accumulated dirt. 

• 
The power supply is in good condition (cable, air­line, battery). 

• 
Insulated casing of the tool is not cracked or damaged. 

• 
Shields or guards are in place and not damaged. 

• 
There are no leaks of fuel, such as petrol or diesel. 

• 
Blades or bits are not damaged or worn. 




Remember that whatever tools or equipment are required for a work task, the correct PPE must always be used. Always visually inspect PPE before use to make sure it is fit for purpose; after use, clean PPE if necessary and store it carefully. 


Daily checks 
Many checks on equipment must be carried out on a daily basis, to ensure the safe and smooth running of a construction site. 
Daily checks are especially important for site vehicles and moving machinery, in order to maintain safe operational standards and protect all workers on site. Checking vehicle fuel levels, lubricant levels and tyre pressures on a daily basis contributes to reliability and efficiency, as well as extending operational life by reducing wear and tear. 

. Figure 14.8 Site machinery being checked 
Lifting and access equipment must be checked before use to confirm it is fit for purpose and in a safe condition. Never assume that because an item seemed safe to use yesterday, it will still be safe to use today. 

To ensure a consistent approach to daily checks, inspection checklists may be produced. Ticking off each item verifies that the corresponding part of the tool or equipment will contribute to its overall correct and safe operation. Checklists should be comprehensive but simple to follow and arranged in a logical order. 

. Figure 14.9 Do not undertake routine inspections casually 
Thorough inspections contribute to increased workplace safety, lower maintenance costs and less downtime. 

Cleaning 
Work on construction sites often generates high levels of dust and airborne debris. Carefully inspecting tools and equipment for cleanliness is a vital part of avoiding deterioration in function and maintaining safety during use. 
Items should be cleaned after use and before storing them, to reduce the likelihood of rust and corrosion. This also allows subsequent users to identify any damage more easily before beginning a work task. 




Cleaning also reduces the rate of wear in moving parts. Dust and dirt that are allowed to accumulate can become abrasive when mixed with lubricants such as oil and grease, and this can cause a significant increase in the rate of wear of bearings, bushes and other moving parts in powered tools and equipment. 

Operational checks 
Even after a tool or piece of equipment has been inspected and confirmed as fit for purpose and safe, the operator must look out for possible faults or defects that can occur during use. For example: 
• 
an electrical power tool could become hot when in use, indicating it is not operating within design performance parameters 

• 
a tool with many rotating parts may show signs of a developing fault by creating increased noise during operation. 


Operatives should be familiar with manufacturers’ instructions, so that tools and equipment are used correctly and developing problems are quickly recognised and dealt with. 
In order to understand safe operational procedures and necessary operational checks on tools and equipment, it is important to check risk assessments, method statements and manufacturers’ instructions before starting a work task. For example, cutting or grinding equipment may require periodic emptying of a dust­collection vessel. 
When tools and equipment fail safety checks 
If defects are discovered in a tool or piece of equipment during inspection or use, the item should be removed from use immediately and the relevant supervisor should be informed. A tag or label should be attached to the item, stating the nature of the problem, and it should be kept in a secure location to avoid inadvertent use. The item should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. 


. Figure 14.11 Worn or rusty drill bits should be replaced without delay 
All power tools must be treated with respect. When replacing drill bits or cutting blades, the power source must be isolated: 
• 
For mains-powered tools, unplug the tool from the source of electricity. 

• 
For petrol- or diesel-powered tools, never attempt adjustments or replacement of parts when the engine is running. 

• 
For battery-powered tools, remove the battery. (Do not assume that battery-powered tools create less force when operating than mains-powered tools – they can cause serious injuries.) 



Keeping records 
Written records on the condition of tools and equipment can be useful in allowing operatives to determine if they are in a suitable condition to permit ongoing use. These are often known as condition reports, and they can be particularly important when monitoring the safety of hired tools and equipment. 
When hired items are delivered to site, they usually have details attached confirming the inspection and testing that has been undertaken to verify their safe condition. On return to the hire company, the condition of the item will be assessed by visual inspection and, if necessary, specified testing for faults and defects. A condition report can then be used to record: 
• 
the results of the inspection and testing to confirm safety and serviceability 

• 
any damage and ongoing wear and tear 

• 
adjustment or replacement of parts. 


Recording inspection and testing results is especially important in the case of electrical equipment, since faults that could lead to injury or death may not be visible to the user and only become apparent when appropriate testing is undertaken by qualified competent personnel. 
Complex equipment may periodically require more thorough inspections to maintain safe condition and serviceability. Programmed reporting provides a history of routine and in-depth inspections that can indicate when a tool or piece of equipment is due for replacement. 
14_12 
. Figure 14.12 More thorough inspections are carried out periodically for complex equipment 
A large contractor may own many tools and items of equipment. As valuable company assets, these must be catalogued. An asset register usually includes the following information for each asset: 

• 
a description 

• 
an identification number 

• 
the date of acquisition • ownership records 

• 
its current value 

• 
its condition and defects 

• 
maintenance requirements and inspection intervals 

• 
information about spares. 


A comprehensive asset register is a useful source of information when a contractor is assessing the capability of a company to take on new work. It allows decisions to be made on whether new equipment should be purchased or hired in order to fulfil a contract. The register must therefore be accurate and kept up to date. 

Safety with electricity 
Since the use of electricity is an everyday part of our lives, it can be easy to take it for granted as an energy source. However, you should always remember that electricity can be dangerous when not treated with respect, with the potential to cause severe injury or even death. Make sure you are properly trained before using electrical equipment in the workplace. Dismantling or adjusting an electrically powered item should only be undertaken by someone who is authorised and qualified. 
The use of electrical equipment on site is regulated by the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (for more on these, see Chapter 1). These regulations require precautions to be taken against the risk of death or personal injury from electricity in work activities. 

When working with or near equipment powered by electricity, be aware of the types of danger that can arise: 
• 
burns and electric shock, which depending on the voltage can kill you 

• 
faults in equipment or wiring, which can cause a fire 

• 
electrical sparks from faulty equipment, which can cause flammable gas to explode. 



Voltages 
A range of voltages are used, depending on the equipment and circumstances. 
In our homes, the usual voltage supplied for domestic appliances is 230 V, commonly referred to as 240 V. The difference in these two voltage figures is because voltages are referred to as ‘nominal’, which means they can vary slightly. 
230 V is often used in workshop environments to power hand tools and fixed machines. Protection for users is provided by a residual current device (RCD). This will disconnect the supply quickly if a fault or unsafe condition occurs. 


On site, a lower voltage of 110 V is recommended, since lower voltages are safer. A piece of equipment called a transformer is used to reduce a 230 V supply to the safer voltage of 110 V. 
Each voltage level is colour-coded, to make identification easier: 


. Figure 14.13 Battery-powered drill 
Although powered by a battery, these are still powerful pieces of equipment that can cause injury if not used with care. For example, a battery-powered drill produces a lot of torque, which can injure an operative’s wrist and forearm. 
1.2Materials 
Fit for purpose 
Materials and components must meet defined quality standards during manufacture. A range of tests are carried out to ensure items leave the manufacturer in a condition that is fit for purpose. 

. Figure 14.14 Manufacturers conduct tests to maintain quality standards 
These tests might establish compressive strength, water absorption, hardness, size, shape, colour and much more. In more technically complex components, testing could include electrical resistance, flow rates, pressure containment and other performance- and safety-related factors. 

Between the manufacturing process and the point of use on site, many activities take place, including transport and storage. If not undertaken with care, these activities can cause damage or create conditions that lead to the development of flaws and defects in materials and components. Operatives on site must be aware of these possibilities and conduct appropriate inspections of materials and components before use. 


The materials and components for particular work tasks are usually detailed in a work specification, which is a contract document. This means that there are legal requirements to ensure the right materials and components are used for a job. Ignoring the specification could have consequences related to the safe condition or operation of the completed work, its durability or its appearance. 
Therefore, materials and components must be checked before use to confirm they match the specification. They should then be inspected for possible faults or defects to confirm that they are fit for purpose. Remember, damage due to poor transport, storage or handling can make items unsuitable for use. 
In addition, care must be taken to avoid damage to materials and components during installation, which could render them unfit for purpose. The removal and replacement of damaged items leads to increased costs and lost time, which can have a significant detrimental impact on the overall work programme. 

. Table 14.2 Examples of damage to or defects in materials and components 
Area  Materials/components  Potential damage or defects that could render items unfit for purpose  
Construction  Sheet materials (for example plywood, plasterboard and insulation)  • Chipped edges, scored surfaces, cracks or splits • Distortion • Damage by moisture or chemicals  
Timber  • Warped, twisted, bent, crushed or cracked • Damage by moisture or chemicals  
Steel  • Twisted, bent, distorted or cracked • Rust or corrosion  
Masonry  • Chips and cracks • Bent, misshapen, dimensionally inaccurate, discoloured or moisture saturated  
BSE  Electrical cables  • Split or punctured insulation • Excessively bent or stretched  
Electrical components (for example switches, sockets, meters, distribution boards and circuit breakers)  • Cracked casings and damaged insulation/switches/fixings • Rating mismatch or indicator failure  
Plumbing components (pipework, junctions, water-storage tanks and cylinders)  • Crushed, kinked, punctured, corroded, rusted or dimensionally inaccurate • Size mismatch, rating mismatch (for example flowrates, thermal output), incorrect valve function  
Heating and ventilation components  • Damage to boiler components or refrigeration unit • Leaks or sensor faults • Incorrect flue gas rating, incorrect filters  


Hazards associated with materials and components 
All operatives must be aware of site hazards and the methods used to identify and manage them. This includes hazards associated with the handling and use of materials and components. 
The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002 require the identification of: 
• 
hazardous substances used on site 

• 
processes on site that may produce hazardous substances. 


The risks to site workers and members of the public must then be assessed and controlled. 


. Figure 14.16 COSHH symbols 
Hazardous substances take different forms, such as powders, liquids or gases: 
• 
Some substances give off harmful vapours/fumes, which can be inhaled (breathed in). 

• 
Other substances are described as irritant or corrosive and can cause damage to the skin when it is exposed to them. 


385 

• 
Certain substances that can be injected, enter cuts in the skin or be absorbed through the skin are toxic (poisonous). 

• 
Hazardous substances that are handled can leave deposits on the skin that can be transferred to the mouth when eating and then swallowed (ingested). 


Read the manufacturer’s or supplier’s safety data sheets carefully. These provide information on how to safely use and store hazardous substances so that risks are minimised. 



. Table 14.3 Common hazards associated with materials and components 
Associated hazard  How it can be caused and what to do  
Back injuries  Incorrect manual handling of heavy and awkward items such as heating units or large heavy sheets of material. • Use kinetic lifting technique and seek assistance when necessary (see Chapter 1 for more on lifting techniques). • Plan movement of heavy materials and components to avoid obstruction in the path of travel. • Where possible, use mechanical lifting equipment to avoid manual handling.  
Crushing injuries to hands and feet  Trapping fingers between heavy items. Dropping heavy items onto feet. • Handle heavy materials and components in manageable quantities. • Always use appropriate PPE (gloves and safety boots). • Where possible, use mechanical lifting equipment to avoid manual handling.  
Inhalation of dust (damage to the respiratory system)  Handling and cutting sheet materials and insulation can create dust and fibres which can be hazardous when inhaled (breathed in). • Always wear correct PPE or RPE (respiratory protective equipment). • Avoid cutting in enclosed spaces. • Consider dust control measures such as water misting or dust-extraction systems.  
Inhalation of fumes (damage to the  Harmful fumes and vapours can be given off by paints, adhesives, chemical

Skin irritation  Irritant or corrosive materials and components can cause damage to the skin. Toxic substances can enter the body through cuts and abrasions or be absorbed through the skin. • Always use the correct PPE. • Use barrier creams. • Consult safety data sheets and COSHH sheets. • Wash hands thoroughly after working with irritants or corrosives.

. Figure 14.17: Safe kinetic lifting technique 
Under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HASAWA) 1974, it is the employer’s responsibility to ensure the safe use, handling, storage and transport of components, materials and substances. (See Chapter 1 for more on HASAWA.) 
However, all operatives must support their employer and others in the workplace by being aware of potential hazards, being observant on site, and handling and using materials and components correctly. 

Quantity 
Calculating accurate quantities of materials and components for a project is important for efficiency and productivity. It: 
• 
ensures the right amounts are delivered to site 

• 
avoids shortages, which can cause production delays 

• 
avoids surpluses, which can cause waste and a negative impact on the environment 

• 
helps keep a project within budget. 

As well as calculating how many items are needed, it may be necessary to establish: 

• 
linear measurements 

• 
area 

• 
volume 

• 
weight 

• 
percentages. 



For more on measuring and calculating quantities for different work tasks and trades, see Chapter 6. 

Specialist requirements 
Some materials and components used in construction are very common, such as cement or timber. However, these common materials can be produced with variations or adaptations for specialist requirements. 
For example, cement can be produced as: 
• 
sulphate-resisting cement – a type of modified Portland cement that can be used in conditions where concrete or mortar is exposed to sulphate attack 

• 
rapid-hardening cement – the one-day strength of this cement is equal to the three-day strength of ordinary Portland cement. 



Timber can be produced as: 
• 
stress-graded timber – classified for strength and stiffness for use as structural support in buildings 

• 
glulam (glued laminated) timber – used to produce structural columns and beams as a sustainable alternative to reinforced concrete and steel. 


Operatives may need additional training in order to use specialist materials effectively and efficiently. For example liquid roofing materials allow the installation of roof coverings where complex geometry and roof shapes make conventional methods difficult to apply. When installed by trained operatives, these roof coverings are quick to install, attractive and durable. 

. Figure 14.18 A finished liquid roof 
With the demand for environmentally friendly construction methods, more specialist materials and components are being developed for various purposes: 
• 
insulation purposes (for example, Icynene spray foam, for application in traditional stone buildings) 

• 
heating and ventilation systems (for example, refined computational fluid dynamics to model movement and temperature of air within spaces, for efficient system design) 

• 
smart electricity generation and management systems (for more on this, see Chapter 8). 




Tools and equipment require appropriate storage and regular maintenance to make them last longer and ensure they are efficient and safe. Materials need to be stored and handled so that they remain functional until they are ready to be brought into use. 

2.1Storage 
Tools and equipment 
Tools and equipment should be stored carefully, to protect them from adverse weather conditions and accidental damage. It is vital that those with metal parts and electrical components are protected from moisture. 
Storage areas should be secure to guard against theft, as tools and equipment are often high-value items. Appropriate storage includes lockable steel containers (such as shipping containers) in a secure outdoor storage compound, or fixed lockable cabinets inside temporary site buildings. 
It may be appropriate to keep an inventory of tools and equipment in a central store, with the requirement for an operative’s signature when removing and returning items to the secure storage facility. 

. Figure 14.19 Steel containers can be used for secure storage on site 
Whatever storage facility is used, it should be managed so that tools and equipment are not randomly deposited or casually stacked. The provision of racks, stands and shadow boards is good practice to keep order and monitor the stock of valuable items. This also reduces the risk of accidental damage. 


Materials 
Storage facilities for materials should be: 
• 
secure, to safeguard against theft 

• 
protected against the weather 

• 
located to allow easy unloading of deliveries 


• organised to allow operatives to find required materials quickly and efficiently. 
Materials should be stored carefully, in order to avoid injuries to operatives and accidental damage, which can add to costs and negatively affect productivity. 
The following are examples of appropriate storage methods: 
• 
Lengths of pipe for plumbing or heating purposes can be stored horizontally in racks according to diameter. 

• 
Electrical items should be stored in a dry, dust-free environment, preferably with stable temperature conditions. 

• 
Small, high-value items, such as door furniture or plumbing fittings, can be kept in lockable cabinets. 

• 
Sheet materials should either be stacked flat, raised off the floor on spaced levelled bearers, or vertically, leaning at a slight incline towards a solid wall or frame. 

• 
Bulk materials, such as sand, and heavy materials, such as bricks and blocks, can be stored in fenced outdoor compounds with protection from the weather provided by tarpaulins or plastic sheeting. These must be arranged to allow easy access by delivery vehicles and mechanical handling machinery. 





2.2Maintenance 
Whether simple or complex, all tools and equipment will deteriorate more quickly if they are not looked after, cleaned and maintained. Keeping them clean and in good working order can improve safety, make work tasks easier and make items last longer. 
As mentioned previously, the accuracy of tools and equipment used for measuring, checking and testing can be reduced if they are not calibrated, checked and maintained regularly. Sensitive equipment can be affected by the harsh conditions experienced on construction sites, and they should be protected from exposure to dust and moisture where possible. Store them in their protective cases when not in use (after drying them if wet) and protect them from situations where they could suffer impact damage. 


Maintenance for simple tools like hammers and screwdrivers is relatively straightforward, consisting of keeping them clean and storing them in dry conditions. 
Hand cutting tools, such as chisels and saws, should be kept sharp as part of a maintenance routine, so that they function efficiently. Blunt tools can increase the likelihood of them slipping or moving unpredictably, which could lead to damage to the work or injury to the operative. 

As mentioned frequently in this chapter, regular inspection should be a habitual practice. A quick visual inspection to make sure a hammer head is securely attached to its handle, or the tip of a screwdriver is not worn or damaged, is an important part of maintenance. Metal parts of tools should be treated with a rust inhibitor periodically. 
More complex tools with moving parts, such as powered cutting equipment or drills, may require lubricating with oil or grease in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Some more specialist items of equipment require the application of specific lubrication products. Check operation manuals and equipment labels to ensure the correct lubrication is used, since using the wrong products can shorten the useful life of expensive items. 
Equipment that has filters to capture dust or keep lubricating oil clean may have a specified maintenance programme, and this should be implemented carefully. Clogged filters cannot perform their function and may damage the equipment beyond repair.

6 Under this legislation, employers must calculate the amount of vibration that employees may be exposed to at work. At a specific level (referred to as the ‘exposure action value’), employers must introduce technical and organisational measures to reduce the risk of personal injury to an acceptable level. 
7 A safe system of work is a formal set of procedures that must be followed when hazards cannot be eliminated completely. 
8 Toolbox talks are short training sessions arranged at regular intervals at a place of work to discuss health and safety issues; they give safety reminders and inform personnel about new hazards that may have recently arisen. These are usually delivered to small groups of workers, in an area of the workplace where they should not be disturbed. These talks usually cover a single aspect of health and safety, such as good housekeeping. 
9 A confined space is a workplace which may be substantially but not always entirely enclosed, where there is a foreseeable serious risk of injury because of the conditions or from hazardous substances. Excavations, loft spaces, sewers or wells could be described as confined spaces, because they are enclosed with restricted access and egress. 
10 Working in a confined space should be avoided wherever possible, and work should be completed in another way without entering the space. If this cannot be done and there is still a significant risk of injury, then the work must be properly risk assessed, planned and organised, with appropriate control measures in place before it starts. Everyone involved in working in a confined space must be competent and specifically trained to undertake their tasks.

I = = 0.34 A 
58 So: P = 20 × 0.34 = 6.8 W 

6 Stored hydro is where stored water, in a lake or reservoir, is released when needed to turn turbines. This can produce electricity almost immediately. Water is then pumped back into the lake or reservoir when the system is not required. 
7 The RCD monitors the current flow in the circuit Line and Neutral. If the two values are balanced, the RCD will not trip. If a fault occurs and some current leaks to earth, less returns in the Neutral and the values become unbalanced. If the value of unbalanced current exceeds the residual current rating of the device, it will trip disconnecting the circuit. 
8 If somebody, for example at work, is in a position where they are subjected to glare from a lamp, where they can see the full harsh light from the lamp, they will likely squint due to the harsh bright light. Exposure can cause discomfort and possibly headaches. Glare can be avoided by deflecting the bright light by diffusers or louvres that soften and scatter the light. 
9 Attenuation is the reduction of sound reverberation. This can be achieved in several ways including: 
– 
Using soft furnishings/fabrics 

– 
Using baffles such as hanging special panels made of soft material/fabrics from the ceiling 

– 
Using soft materials or fabrics on the walls or carpeting the floor. 10 Wall area is: 3 × 3 × 2 = 18 m2 2 × 3 × 2 = 12 m2 Less door: 2 × 0.9 = 1.8 m2 So:

6 A greenfield site is an undisturbed piece of land that has never been developed (for example with roads, buildings or other structures). However, a brownfield site may have an existing structure (above or below ground), or may have been previously developed and the structure or building removed. Developing a brownfield site can be more expensive compared with a greenfield site, because of the costs involved in preparing the site and the removal of any contaminated soil. Brownfield sites are often preferred for use by local planning departments as they have less impact on the natural environment. 

7 Vernacular construction is where the design of houses is sympathetic or particular to a region, relying on locally sourced materials and traditional skills that have developed over generations. Given the distinct regional characteristics of such buildings, it is problematic to design and specify this form of construction anywhere other than where it is usually found. It would be difficult to achieve the same standards of workmanship without employing labour and sourcing materials from further away.

6 Self-employed subcontractors are responsible for every part of running a business, for example estimating, invoicing, ordering and accounts. They do not receive some of the benefits that employed people enjoy, for example holiday pay (including bank holidays), sick pay, maternity or paternity leave or pay. 
7 Building Information Modelling (BIM) uses digital technology to share construction documentation and provide a platform for effective and efficient collaboration between designers and the construction team at every stage of a building project. It is adaptable to suit the size and complexity of each project and allows technical information to be shared throughout the management and construction teams. 
8 Clients sometimes withhold a percentage of money due to the contractor at each stage of the building work; this is known as a retention. The exact percentage of money to be withheld has to be agreed between the client and contractor before work starts and is usually 3–5 per cent. The retention acts as financial security for the client, to make sure the contractor finishes the building work and resolves any snagging within a reasonable amount of time after completion of the work; this is known as the defects liability period. If the contractor does not return to complete the work within the period agreed in the contract, the client has reasonable grounds to use the money to instruct other contractors to undertake the outstanding work. On the other hand, if the contractor does complete the project and resolve all of the defects identified within the defects liability period, the client must release the outstanding retention payment without delay.

6 When planning and delivering a construction project, sustainability is achieved by: 
– 
using renewable and recyclable resources 

– 
sourcing materials locally 

– 
protecting resources 

– 
reusing and refurbishing materials 

– 
reducing energy consumption and waste 

– 
creating a healthy and eco-friendly environment 

– 
protecting the natural environment. 7 Five retrofit roles: 

– 
Retrofit assessors undertake retrofit assessments for dwellings in accordance with PAS 2035. 

– 
Retrofit coordinators provide a project management role. 

– 
Retrofit advisors provide advice to clients and homeowners on the retrofit process. 

– 
Retrofit designers prepare a safe and effective retrofit design. 

– 
Retrofit evaluators monitor the impact of installed EEMs to ensure the intended outcomes have been met. 


8 Social sustainability focuses on wellbeing and quality of life. It involves recognising the needs of everyone impacted by construction projects, from design to demolition. This includes construction workers, local communities, project supply chains and users of the building. 
9 Passivhaus, or ‘Passive house’ in English, is an energy performance standard intended primarily for new buildings. It ensures buildings are so well constructed, insulated and ventilated that they require little energy for heating or cooling. 
10 Grey water is waste water that has been used for washing and is generated from hand basins, washing machines, showers and baths. Rather than sending it down the drain, it can be reused for watering plants and flushing toilets, thereby reducing mains water usage. 
Rainwater harvesting involves collecting rainwater from roofs, filtering it and storing it for reuse, thereby saving energy, lowering carbon emissions and reducing mains water consumption.

6 Accurate calculation of quantities of materials and components allows for assessment of the time needed to use and install those materials, contributing to the creation of a realistic work programme. Completion targets can then be set to support efficiency and productivity and satisfy the client’s requirements for timely handover of the building. 
7 Tolerances allow for acceptable variations in the strength of materials, the performance of a heating or ventilation system, temperature ranges in which materials can be used and many other situations. Exceeding allowable tolerances for a given construction task will mean that the work does not meet the specification. The function of the structure could be compromised and other elements of the building may not be able to be installed properly. 
8 If a building that is not dimensionally accurate or not built to square is handed over to the client, significant problems can emerge when the installation of items such as floor tiles is attempted, or fittings and modular components such as kitchen units are positioned. Necessary remedial work would be potentially very costly to the contractor and disruptive to the client. 
9 If the height of floors is not measured accurately during installation, a staircase will be placed at the wrong angle of slope, and it may not sit properly where the top of the stairs meets the upper floor. 
10 U-value expresses the rate of transfer of heat through a structure (or more correctly through one square metre of a structure), taking account of the difference between internal and external temperatures. It is expressed in watts per metre squared kelvin (W/m²K). The lower the U-value, the lower the rate of heat transfer. 
Measured resistance to heat transfer is expressed as an R-value. The higher the R-value, the more resistance a material provides to heat transfer.

6 Off-site construction involves manufacturing modules in factories and then transporting them to site where they are assembled to form major elements of a building. It offers many benefits: 
– 
Automated systems improve accuracy and quality control. 

– 
Large numbers of components can be manufactured quickly and efficiently with reduced waste. 

– 
By carrying out a large proportion of the construction work in a controlled factory environment, the delays associated with adverse weather conditions on site are avoided. 

– 
Up to 95 per cent of a building can be constructed in a factory, therefore reducing the number of trades needed on site during the assembly and final finishing of the project. 

– 
There are cost savings from mass production in factories. 


7 First fix is the phase of work completed after the structure has been erected and before plastering commences. Once the various trades have completed their first-fix work and the plastering/drylining is finished, second-fix work can commence. Second fixing often involves the installation of items and equipment that could have easily been damaged or affected by earlier stages of construction work. 
8 Benefits of autonomous vehicles include: 
– 
reduced costs by improving productivity and site progress, because they are able to operate 24 hours a day without a driver 

– 
fewer carbon emissions than vehicles driven by humans, due to less erratic movements and more efficient use 

– 
better safety and accuracy.

Long answer 6 When a set of data is used to describe or analyse other data, this is referred to as metadata. It speeds up the analysis of information required for technical design processes and could inform an architect regarding multiple intricate design elements of a building. 7 Generalisation is essentially a process of ‘pulling back’ from the mass of raw data to gain a broader, more general view and reduce the extent of analysis required. It avoids the need to process large volumes of complex data, which could be time consuming and confusing. 8 BIM allows authorised users to access a range of important information at all stages of construction and beyond. It uses digitally processed information to analyse design elements of a building, including 3D modelling. 
Using BIM, complex design ideas can be transformed into a medium that is easier for all personnel to work with. It allows collaboration between every designer, engineer and contractor working on a project, providing comprehensive information about different workflows. 
The Common Data Environment (CDE) is a single central source of information used within a BIM system. Relevant documents and data are brought together in a shared digital environment that can be accessed by all authorised personnel collaborating on the project. 
9 When a building is handed over from the contractor to the client for occupation and brought into use, data can be harvested to answer important questions, such as: 
– 
How successful was the delivery of the project by the contractor? 

– 
Was the project delivered and handed over on time – if not, why not? 

– 
Does the building meet its design brief fully now it is in use? 

– 
What changes could be made to improve 


performance? This data can be useful to contractors who build repeat structures or specialise in specific project types. 
10 When calculating outcomes, data can be used to analyse past or current activities to model what could happen in the future. An example might be calculating the outcome of using timber of specific dimensions to produce a load-bearing element of a building, such as a suspended floor. Consistent data has been recorded over many years which can be applied to producing reliable structural calculations, ensuring that the proposed design is safe and capable of bearing the required loads. Other examples of data might be performance charts for heating systems. 
Cost calculations draw on data that is collated, analysed, modelled and interpreted by the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). All sizes of construction company depend on accurate data to produce costings that will result in profitability for the contractor and a fair price for the client.

Distributive negotiation is used to haggle over a common single interest at stake, known as a fixed sum. A fixed sum is best described as a pie that parties are battling over for a bigger slice, with exchange offers back and forth. 

– 
The win–lose approach is probably the most common negotiation method used to settle disputes between two parties. An agreement is more difficult to reach, because one side has to compromise in order for the other to experience a positive outcome. 

– 
The lose–lose approach – following negotiations, all concerned parties end up worse off and not achieving their desired result. All participants should try to minimise their losses and to make sure they are fair. 

– 
The compromise approach is used to settle disputes quickly by one party settling for less than it may have hoped for, in order to reduce strained negotiations and maintain or fix a relationship. 

– 
Integrative negotiation is used by parties with common interests, in order to collaborate in finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

– 
The win–win approach – negotiators with shared interests work together to find resolutions they are both satisfied with, rather than seeking to fulfil self-interests. This avoids disagreements and helps to maintain strong relationships between parties, while achieving a fair outcome for both sides. 



7 An example of unethical behaviour in a business: during the development of a new construction site, a contractor wilfully damages protected trees (TPO – Tree Preservation Order) with a digger and contaminates a local stream with harmful construction waste.

8 Digital CAD systems can speed up the design process considerably, leading to greater productivity. 
Building design ideas created using specialist software can be presented as a three-dimensional (3D) model, allowing stakeholders to examine and refine the design concept. 

400 
Digital tools are able to generate accurate materials and components lists from 3D models or 2D drawings. These can be linked digitally to materials costs databases, in order to produce an up-to-date costing for a project. 
Speeding up the process of designing and costing a project, coupled with the ability to update or amend project details quickly, streamlines development and improves productivity. 
Since CAD drawings are produced digitally, they 
can easily be stored, retrieved, shared and copied. 

9 Equipment and machinery can be fitted with digital sensor technology to operate as part of the IoT. The range of movement and operational area of excavators and other machines can be controlled automatically, and programming can be updated to match new instructions from remote control locations.

Long answer 6 Business types include: 
– 
sole traders – must be registered with HMRC as a sole trader. As a proprietor, they have full control of their entire business or enterprise, although they could employ other people to work for them. A sole trader is responsible for the day-to-day management of their company, including filing self-assessment tax returns with HMRC and paying National Insurance contributions. Sole traders are personally liable for any losses or debts that the company may incur if things go wrong. 

– 
partnerships – are owned by two or more individuals. Partners share the costs, duties and risks of managing a business together, although they may delegate certain responsibilities. Each partner is personally responsible for paying tax and National Insurance contributions, based 



on their share of the profits. There are three different types of business partnership: ordinary partnership, limited partnership and limited liability partnership (LLP) 
– 
limited companies – private (Ltd) or public (PLC) – must be registered with HMRC and Companies House and file tax returns. The owners and shareholders have limited liability, so their personal assets are protected against any business debts up to the value of the money that they have invested. In a PLC, money can be raised for the business through investors (for example the public) buying shares on the stock exchange. 

– 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – in the UK, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are defined as follows: 

– 
Small – employs on average no more than 50 people and has an annual turnover of £10.2 million or less 

– 
Medium-sized – employs on average no more than 250 people and has an annual turnover of £36 million or less 



– 
not-for-profit organisations– are charitable businesses that do not make a financial profit. They often seek to provide a public service or social benefits for individuals or communities in need. 

– 
community interest companies (CICs) – aim to provide a benefit for the community or trade with a social purpose. Returns to the company owners and investors are allowed, as long as they are balanced and reasonable, and a dividend cap must be in place. 

– 
franchises – allow a business to expand quickly with lower capital outlay by selling the rights to the business model to self-employed entrepreneurs, referred to as ‘franchisees’. 


7 A sole trader is personally liable for any losses or debts that the company may incur if things go wrong. Creditors can legally recover any money owed by the debtor from their business or their personal assets such as their house. If the debt is considerable and the individual is unable to pay, they could be made personally bankrupt. This could result in further difficulties, for example being unable to obtain any type of credit such as a mortgage, credit card or finance on a vehicle because they are deemed to be a high risk. 
8 The main goal of the ISO is to facilitate trade. It offers solutions to global challenges and supports innovation by providing guidelines to streamline processes and improve quality and safety across a range of businesses and products. 

9 The purpose of an organisation’s corporate social responsibilities (CSR) is to actively make a positive contribution to the community and wider society, and to minimise any negative impacts caused by their business. Having a CSR strategy integrated into its values also affects how stakeholders (such as clients and investors) view an organisation and whether or not they decide to work with or support it. 
10 Areas that can be measured in terms of a value are known as key performance indicators (KPIs). Measuring business performance against KPIs helps to establish if objectives have been met or whether new strategic targets need to be planned. If a business is not honest with the findings of KPIs, fails to learn from its mistakes and starts the cycle again, then the process of benchmarking is pointless.

super-cold vapour/liquid mix, which creates the refrigeration effect. The vapour/liquid mix passes through an evaporator, where final expansion to a vapour takes place. This vapour then enters the compressor for the cycle to begin again. 

Long answer 
6 A heat pump warms or cools a building by moving heat from a low-temperature reservoir to another reservoir at a higher temperature. Its working principles are the same as for a refrigerator, which creates heat while making the refrigerator cold. 
The process is known as the vapour-compression refrigeration cycle and involves compressing a gas (called the refrigerant) with a compressor until it becomes a liquid. This generates useful heat that can be used to warm a building. When the pressure is released through an expansion valve, very cold temperatures are generated, which can be used for cooling a building. 

7 Fire alarm systems provide early detection and warning of a fire. They usually consist of a control panel linked to fire detectors and manual call points (often referred to as detection zones) and alarm circuits. 
– 
Category M systems rely on manual operation by the people using the building. The usual method of raising the alarm is to break the glass on a manual call point. 

– 
Category L systems provide automatic fire detection (AFD) and are designed primarily to protect life. This category is subdivided, according to the areas of the building that require the installation of AFD. 

– 
Category P systems provide AFD and are designed primarily to protect property. This category is subdivided, with P1 requiring AFD in all areas of the building and P2 requiring AFD only in specific parts of the building. 



8 Rainwater systems collect and carry away rain from roofs using either integrated channels or eaves­mounted gutters connected to rainwater pipes. The water is discharged into surface-water drains, combined sewers, soakaways or water courses such as streams and rivers. 
The purpose of a rainwater system is to: 
– 
protect the foundations of the building 

– 
reduce ground erosion 

– 
prevent damp and water penetration of the building. 



These systems can also be used as part of a 
rainwater-harvesting system. 
9 Secondary circulation prevents the wastage of water due to excessive lengths of hot-water draw-off from the storage vessel to the outlet. It is a method of returning the hot-water draw-off back to the storage cylinder in a continuous loop, to eliminate cold-water ‘dead legs’ by reducing the distance the hot water must travel before it arrives at the taps. In all installations, secondary circulation incorporates a bronze- or stainless-steel-bodied circulating pump to circulate the water to and from the storage cylinder. 
10 Central-heating systems distribute warmth throughout the whole or part of a building from a single heat source (the boiler), for the thermal comfort of the occupants. Boilers can be fuelled by coal, gas, oil or electricity; they transfer their heat energy to another medium, usually water or air, which carries the heat to the areas where it is needed.

Short answer 
1 Planned preventative maintenance (PPM) is scheduled to take place at a particular time, for example monthly or annually. It is designed to prevent breakdowns and improve efficiency. Reactive maintenance is unplanned and carried 
out when a system (or part of a system) fails. 
2 A refrigeration or air-conditioning system 
3 One year 
4 Servicing logbook 
5 When a system is out of action while maintenance/ 
servicing is completed 
Long answer 
6 Unvented hot-water system: inspection of line strainer, pressure-reducing valve, pressure-relief valve, temperature/pressure relief, high limit stat and expansion vessel 
Drainage system: visually inspect pipes for damage, check all traps for correct seal levels, perform an air test of the stack system (as per Part H of the Building Regulations), carry out a performance test of the system (as per Part H of the Building Regulations) 
Domestic wiring system: visual inspection of wiring and components for damage, testing of consumer unit residual current device (RCD), testing of the miniature circuit breaker (MCB), carrying out portable appliance testing (PAT), carrying out a polarity test, insulation resistance test and earth loop impedance test 

7 The maintenance plan should include: 
– 
Visually inspect all components. 

– 
Clean passive infrared (PIR) sensor. 

– 
Check all cameras. 

– 
Clean lenses. 

– 
Check correct focus. 

– 
Check alarm bell or siren is triggering and audible. 

– 
Check hard drives for recording capability. 

– 
Check functionality of key pads/touch pads. 

– 
Check emergency lighting. 

– 
Check outside alarm box. 

– 
Check for autodial to keyholder/security company/police. 



8 This will vary according to the manufacturer’s instructions. However, a fire extinguisher needs to be serviced by a professional every 12 months. A competent person needs to carry out a visual inspection once a month to check there are no faults. 
Commercial fire alarms need to be inspected and maintained by a professional every six months, as per BS 5839. 

9 A job sheet should include the: 
– 
client’s name 

– 
site location 

– 
date and time 

– 
priority of the task 



– work to be carried out. 10 The potential implications will vary, according to whether the offline electrical systems are isolated to one building or area, or affect the whole business. If the maintenance is completed out of hours, for 
example at night or over the weekend, there will be less inconvenience. 
Total closure of a building, particularly for a business that relies heavily on communications and data systems, could lead to a loss of both existing income and potential new business. 
Some businesses might have contingency plans that allow their staff to work from home, however again this might have huge financial implications due to equipment compatibility and GDPR compliance. 
It is essential that all data is backed up before systems are taken offline, as there is the potential to lose data when systems have downtime for maintenance.

3 To detect flaws and porous areas in protective coatings applied to metal surfaces 
4 Bring it to the attention of your supervisor or line manager to get advice 
5 Any two of the following: 
– 
burns and electric shock, which depending on the voltage can kill you 

– 
faults in equipment or wiring, which can cause a fire 

– 
electrical sparks from faulty equipment, which can cause flammable gas to explode. 


Long answer 
6 If defects are discovered in tools or equipment during inspection or use: 
– 
The item should be removed from use immediately and the relevant supervisor should be informed. This prevents injury to operatives. 

– 
A tag or label should be attached to the item, stating the nature of the problem. This ensures any other operatives who might use the tool are aware of the problem. 


– 
The item should be kept in a secure location. This will prevent inadvertent use. 

– 
The item should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. 



7 The operative completing the check/inspection has accountability to the user of the tool or equipment, by confirming that the item is safe to use and should operate as expected. 
8 Operatives should be familiar with manufacturers’ instructions, so that tools and equipment are used correctly and developing problems are quickly recognised and dealt with. 
9 This means that there are legal requirements to ensure the right materials and components are used for a job. Ignoring the specification could have consequences related to the safe condition or operation of the completed work, its durability or its appearance. 
10 Calculating accurate quantities of materials and components for a project is important for efficiency and productivity. It: 
– 
ensures the right amounts are delivered to site 

– 
avoids shortages, which can cause production delays 

– 
avoids surpluses, which can cause waste and a negative impact on the environment 

– 
helps keep a project within budget.
